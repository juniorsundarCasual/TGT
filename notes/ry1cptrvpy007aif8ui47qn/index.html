<p>Dora flew backwards as the floor beneath her turned solid-liquid almost immediately. As she was carried towards the gaping black maws that came as tears in space itself, she observed Fancy turning direction mid-air and diving straight towards her. Dora finger tips wrapped around Fancy's extended front limb, but Fancy's struggles to escape the unrelenting suction from the void beyond the tear was pointless. They were caught.</p>
<p>Luckily, she wasn't alone in her disorienting journey through the maddening warp unlike her brother. Fancy wrapped her wings around Dora and the two individuals held on in a tight embrace. They spun, twisted and tilted continuously, not knowing which side was up and which side was down. It felt like being thrusted through a very narrow tunnel undergoing peristalsis.</p>
<p>Dora tried to scream and shout, but the voice that left her throat did not leave her lips, nor did she hear anything in return. It was the first time in her life she heard true, and complete, silence. There were no tiny chatter of insects, nor was there the near imperceptible bumbling of birds echoing in the wind. She would have loved to dwell in this serenity and peace if not for the utter uncertainty she was drowning in.</p>
<p>The only reason she wasn't panicking was that she was gracefully nestled in Fancy's embrace. The faint heat emanating from the cold-blooded insect was like the warmth from the comforting sun when compared against the emotional and physical coldness in the vast void she was hurtling through. But as time progressed, or didn't, the forgotten panic was starting to inch in. Closer, and closer.</p>
<p>But then suddenly, a bright dot of light caught Dora's eyes. She focused on it, and was delighted to learn that she was approaching it, very quickly. Within seconds, the minute dot engorged itself and swallowed the void whole. Then just as she was sucked into this darkness, the light pulled her and Fancy out.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first thing Dora noticed wasn't the soft, dewey grass she landed on, or the fresh air that cleansed her airway, but the return of all the sound that had disappeared in the void.</p>
<p>The voices had returned. But they were different.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual cacophony of chatter with each voice talking over the other, it was... different. It was like a symphony. A graceful layering of voices and sounds, one on top of the other, but each complementing the previous one. There was an intricate call and response, no voice was unnecessary. It was like a well designed conversation with no wasted words, with aptly placed silences in between so that the senses weren't being overwhelmed at every moment.</p>
<p>It was serene.</p>
<p>But amidst this serenity, a new voice barged in like a bull in a china shop.</p>
<p>"Dora! Are you okay?!" Dora raised her head and observed Fancy dusting herself off and spreading her majestic wings.</p>
<p>"Fancy?"</p>
<p>Dora rushed towards the insect as she arose from the mound of dirt she had landed on. With a flap of her wings, she lifted off the ground and hovered around Dora, while her antennae started to skitter all over the little girl to ensure that nothing was off.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" Dora asked, ignoring the anxious and concerned insect altogether.</p>
<p>"I do not know," Fancy answered. "But it does not 'feel' like home."</p>
<p>That was putting it lightly. Because the ambience felt denser and heavier. It wasn't just the increasingly humid air that nearly suffocated her with every breath, but the fact that the trees were at least five times taller than the tallest tree she had ever seen in her entire life. She had no idea how the sunlight even made it past the dense canopy of green up above and illuminated the ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a silence fell in the area, with the only sound disturbing the eerie pause being the faint rustling of the leaves. The 'music' had just stopped. After straining her hearing further, Dora managed to hear faint chatter in the background, but it was far too low in volume to make sense of. But she also noticed that it was moving away.</p>
<p>"I think we scared the animals away," Dora commented. But then, as she turned to face Fancy, she noticed her companion remaining stiff with the hairs that decorated her body standing in an unusually upright angle - a clear sign of fear!</p>
<p>"We must hide!" Fancy warned before quickly grabbing Dora with her appendages and flying upwards. They found footing in a high enough branch that sufficiently secluded them and waited.</p>
<p>"Wha-"</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>The tree they were on rumbled slightly causing Dora whose hold was weak to nearly fall over. Luckily, Fancy was proactive and nudged nudged the girl back to safety.</p>
<p>"Wha-"</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>This time, the vibrations were more vigorous, and approaching them frantically. Dora was ready for this one, though. And she didn't bother to ask anything, because the source of the tremours quite literally barrelled through the treeline, uprooting a few of the towering trees in the process.</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOOOOO!" The creature bellowed, with a voice that boomed and reverberated violently. It was massive, with its height reaching as high as the branch Dora was on. It had flowing, dirty-brown hair that covered its body. It was semi-humanoid with large, muscular arms and an ape-like, flattened face. It's eyes were rage-filled red and its long aged beard waved haphazardly as the creature swatted away the sturdy trees in its path as though they were toothpicks.</p>
<p>The creature was angry, but also afraid - Dora could hear it in its voice.</p>
<p>"Encircle," a tired voice commanded. The volume was low, but it cut through the ruckus like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>A dangerous silence descended as the hurtling creature turned around and looked towards the source of the command with abject fear in its eye. For a moment, Dora shuddered to think about what being could extract fear out of such a horrific creature.</p>
<p>Four entities drenched in black and red flashed through the treeline like a blur. Dora could barely follow the movement before the entities positioned themselves strategically around the massive creature, boxing it in. A shriek nearly escaped Dora's lips as she finally observed the entities - they were massive spiders the size of cows.</p>
<p>"Capture," the same tired voice commanded. In an instant, the cow-sized spiders ejected thicks webs from their posterior. The spiders rapidly encircled the large creature, as it in turn tried to frantically rip apart the fibres to save itself.</p>
<p>Then, while the creature becam entangled in the webbing, another entity entered the clearing with unamused steps. This entity looked like a little person (about Dora's height), with pale pink skin, sharp ears, piercing green eyes, and a haughty expression that bordered on unimpressed. Dora noticed two small peaks on the entity's chest, which she figured meant that the entity was female (according to Medium Sis Jean's lessons). The little person moved aside the long coat hanging over her and adjusted her cuffs.</p>
<p>"Finish it up, now," the little woman said as she slowly turn around to leave. The spiders followed the order religiously and closed in on the creature that was growing tired, and wrapped it up in their web.</p>
<p>At that instance, a loud roar cut through the silence. Dora followed the sound, and through the woods a humanoid rushed forward on all fours. This humanoid was neither man nor animal, it was a hybrid - a mix with a mutated wolf head of some sort and a dark-skinned human with heavy musculature.</p>
<p>The half-man-half-wolf beelined towards the trapped creature, leapt and swept its paws downwards in one swift motion. Large blades of wind burst forth and decimated the webbing in an instant.</p>
<p>The now released creature let out a small grunt, "Thank you-"</p>
<p>"GO!" The wolf-headed hybrid yelled before blocking the spiders from reinitiating their attack.</p>
<p>"Hold it," the little woman said, causing the spiders to freeze instantly. "Do you darkies have nothing better to do? You just cost me a new pet."</p>
<p>The hybrid let out a sarcastic snort and said, "A Behemoth's place isn't to grovel underneath the feet of enslavers. They are majestic creatures that maintain the balance in the forest."</p>
<p>"I don't have time to listen to you preach nonsense," the little woman interjected before waving her hand, "Take him out."</p>
<p>The spiders leapt into action, with two of them firing their webbing to catch the hybrid by his limbs. But the man dodged and attacked the other two simultaneously. With one swipe of his claws, the two spiders were sliced in half. In the meantime the first two split up and started to gain altitude by climbing up the trees.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one of them chose the tree Dora was on as its target. The hybrid didn't waste a moment and swiped the tree by its base, decimating the trunk and causing it to hurtle towards the ground.</p>
<p>"AAAAA!" Dora shrieked as she reached towards a floating Fancy. But the two got caught in the branches as they followed the tree in its downward trajectory. Dora held her breath for the inevitable fall, but was surprised to find herself in a soft embrace.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and was started to meet the predatory yellows eyes of the wolf-man.</p>
<p>"Who-" was all he could say before webbing started to descend on him like rain. He struggled, a lot, but it was useless. The white fibres were like quicksand, and within seconds he was turned into a cocoon. Dora was also bathed in white fibres, along with Fancy, but she noticed that her prison was a lot laxer. She hanged, suspended by strings, and slowly rotated.</p>
<p>"What do we have here?" The tired voice said with some suprise in her tone. "Two creatures I haven't seen before."</p>
<p>"H-Help..." Dora pleaded.</p>
<p>"And one of them talks the common tongue," the woman said with a faint smirk. "How fascinating!"</p>

She hanged, suspended by strings, and slowly rotated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we have here?\" The tired voice said with some suprise in her tone. \"Two creatures I haven't seen before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"H-Help...\" Dora pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And one of them talks the common tongue,\" the woman said with a faint smirk. \"How fascinating!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/TGT/notes/um76iuv0rfpqfh0t846h5h1\"\u003eChapter 410 - Regrouping\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBacklinks\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/TGT/notes/r2ja4inmls8duhuwxyp5nqa\"\u003eChapter 408 - Premature Burial\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n\u003e Word Count:\n\u003e\n\u003e Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\u003e \n\u003e Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"ry1cptrvpy007aif8ui47qn"},"buildId":"ph39nQF1ahHPnyA4smxu1","assetPrefix":"/TGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

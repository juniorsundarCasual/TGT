<p>It was not uncommon in this world for individuals to resolve their differences through combat. With the existence of magic, it was a trivial matter to treat most injuries that would have been fatal back in Guy's old world.</p>
<p>Therefore, within Radiant Academy, there were multiple combat rings distributed across the campus. There just so happened to be one right next to the wing where the teachers' offices were located.</p>
<p>The news that the academy's poster boy was challenged to a duel was too juicy! A crowd was forming around the duelling ring, filled with people providing pertinent exposition in the form of generic dialogue.</p>
<p>"What's happening here?" Mob character A asked.</p>
<p>Mob character B, who was already part of the crowd provided a sufficiently descriptive response, "Jo Way challenged Teacher Hinds to a duel."</p>
<p>"What? Is that braggart crazy?" Mob character A exclaimed. The situation did not conform to common logic after all.</p>
<p>Mob character B realised that this individual was lacking information on the backstory surrounding this confrontation. So being the friendly bystander that he was, he elaborated, "Apparently Teacher Hinds was holding onto Jo's student's allocated resources. And so Jo challenged Teacher Hinds for it."</p>
<p>Mob character A finally understood the context and, as a being capable of complex thought, offered his opinion, "That's admirable but still! How does he expect to win against a Foundation Establishment mage when his realm is only at Late stage Mana Condensation?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to tear you apart Jo Way!" Blevin arrogantly declared. </p>
<p>Noticing how the others were looking at him with a distorted expression, he realised that he came across as a bully who targeted the weak. So he then added on magnanimously, "As your senior, I will give you a 5 hit head start."</p>
<p>That caused the spectator's expressions to soften.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ring, Gaige and Mai were trying their hardest to discourage Wei Zao from going through with the duel.</p>
<p>"Teacher Way, why don't we leave it? I don't need the academy's resources, I can try contacting my family," Gaige said while trying to reason with his teacher.</p>
<p>"I agree with Gaige, Jo. I think you're being really reckless here. I appreciate you standing up for me, but you're just coming across as a brash braggart!" Mai commented as she tried to suppress her growing discomfort.</p>
<p>It wasn't that no one had ever stood up or spoken up for her. As a woman with remarkable beauty, it was a common occurrence. But usually, those pursuers would give in if they were forced to confront someone superior. It was a natural reaction and she understood it, but deep down she resented those spineless men who couldn't follow through on their promises.</p>
<p>And while she did have some grievance with Wei Zao for his usual braggadocio, the fact that he was willing to put himself in danger's way for her sake raised her opinion of him.</p>
<p>'Even if he loses, I will try and be a little more accomodating with him,' she thought to herself silently.</p>
<p>Wei Zao simply patted Gaige's shoulder and said, "Don't worry! I am not someone who tries to bite off more than he can chew. I wouldn't have proposed this duel if I wasn't confident in my chances of winning."</p>
<p>He then turned to Mai and said, "And I am not doing this for you. I just don't like it when superiors try to take unwelcome advances on their juniors simply by virtue of their position and power."</p>
<p>Gaige's eyes widened. Over the past few weeks, he had gotten a new perspective on his teacher and had slowly relinquished his prior opinions that were built on "false" rumours.</p>
<p>Unlike what was being disseminated through word of mouth, Gaige saw that his teacher was far more knowledgeable and capable. The efficacy of the specialised cultivation method and the Bloodline Partial-Awakening potion was indicative of that fact. Furthermore, whenever Gaige had troubles in his cultivation or his martial arts, Teacher Way was able to pinpoint the weaknesses and areas for improvement almost instantly.</p>
<p>So Gaige concluded that there must have been a reason for his teacher to suppress his popularity and build a negative image of himself. Why? That Gaige didn't know. But he fully believed that his teacher, who was all-knowing and capable, definitely had a plan.</p>
<p>Mai wanted to take one last shot at reasoning with Wei Zao and so she turned towards Gaige and nudged him.</p>
<p>Gaige ignored those signals and resolutely raised his fists in a cheer, "I believe in you, Teacher!"</p>
<p>Wei Zao smiled and turned to face Blevin who was well prepared at this point.</p>
<p>Wei Zao concentrated on his opponent, and instantly a book with Blevin Hinds written on it materialised inside his Omniscient Library.</p>
<p>Blevin noticed that Wei Zao had a dazed expression and smirked inwardly.</p>
<p>'Let's see how far your bragging can take you!' he sneered.</p>
<p>"Ready when you are!" He then mocked.</p>
<p>Wei Zao ignored those taunting shouts and focused on the information before him.</p>
<p>Honestly, Wei Zao wasn't sure about his chances of victory either. He didn't even have a record on his opponent when he picked this fight. It was just that he was fed up with all the ridicule this body had received.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, he had been putting out one fire after another that the original "Jo Way" had lit through his unfettered foolhardiness. Blevin just happened to be the last person on his list.</p>
<p>But the reason Wei Zao was not too worried was that he now had some confidence in the powers of the Omniscient Library. While in the beginning, he had some dislike for the passiveness of the library - especially how it couldn't even offer him any gacha benefits like potions or artefacts - it had proven its mettle time and time again.</p>
<p>One of its benefits was the ability to pinpoint any mage's channel convergence point. No two mages had similar mana channel distributions. It was a unique characteristic known only to the mages, and possibly their physicians.</p>
<p>As their name suggested, these points acted as nodes where multiple mana channels converged as one. The quantity of these points in a mage's body was countable in one hand. Moreover, these points were never static and could relocate once the mage breaks through to higher realms.</p>
<p>The reason for such a level of secrecy concerning a mage's mana channel distribution was due to the existence of these channel convergence points. If an opposing mage were to strike these convergence points and channel their own mana through them, the shellshock could instantly incapacitate the person.</p>
<p>Wei Zao read through the entry on Blevin and recognised the location of the convergence point that was easiest to reach, which was conveniently located right above the liver.</p>
<p>Wei Zao returned from his daze and lowered his body for stability.</p>
<p>When Blevin saw the sudden change in Wei Zao's expression, he started feeling uneasy. While he was confident in his chances of victory before, now he felt a little threatened. When he realised the shift in his own mental state, he gritted his teeth and prepared himself for the upcoming onslaught. He cursed at himself silently for giving Wei Zao that 5 hit head start.</p>
<p>Wei Zao didn't waste any time and channelled mana into his appendages. He was going to take full advantage of those 5 hits!</p>
<p>With a sudden burst, he covered the distance between himself and Blevin, and then he reeled his right arm for an upward jab.</p>
<p>Blevin calculated the trajectory of the punch and curled his left arm for an upward block. As a Foundation Establishment mage, the punch appeared to hurtle towards him only at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Just as he let down his guard, Wei Zao propelled his left arm for a quick jab right below the liver. Blevin's eyes widened as he saw the fist closing in on him. Although a liver punch wouldn't incapacitate him like a regular person, the problem was that his convergence point happened to fall at a location right where the fist was headed. Usually, he'd be careful in guarding that region. But he became negligent when facing the seemingly weak Wei Zao.</p>
<p>The jab connected. Blevin hoped that it was just a simple hit, but to his horror, he felt Wei Zao channel his own mana towards that point.</p>
<p>'How did he know!' Blevin screamed internally.</p>
<p>But before he could do anything, he felt the energy leaving his body.</p>
<p>As Blevin cursed his poor luck, Wei Zao reeled back and jabbed at the same point once again while screaming, "2!"</p>
<p>Blevin's started to sweat as he anticipated what was about to happen next.</p>
<p>PUNCH "3!"</p>
<p>PUNCH "4!"</p>
<p>PUNCH "5!"</p>
<p>After the fifth punch, Blevin summarily evacuated his bowels and fell over into his mess. He couldn't control his body at all. The first two punches were sufficiently cushioned by his superior physique, but the following three struck while his body was powerless. He wanted to cry but couldn't shed any tears because his entire body had shut down at this point.</p>
<p>"Thank you for the 5 hit head start, Teacher. I am grateful," Wei Zao said in a mocking tone.</p>
<p>The incontinent Blevin was so agitated that he started to throw up blood uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Wow... I never knew that people could actually throw up blood in real life... It doesn't make any anatomical sense..." Guy muttered as he mused at the situation.</p>
<p>Wei Zao casually dusted his clothes and walked towards the wooden box next to the ring, under the sparkling gazes of Gaige and Mai. He picked it up, bowed towards the crowd and walked away.</p>
<p>Everyone present slowly dispersed while gossiping about what just happened. The only two people that remained were Guy and Markus.</p>
<p>"Wait! He just took all the resources! Did he forget about us?" Guy screamed.</p>
<p>Sadly no one minded him. And those who did hear him channelled the noise through one ear out the other.</p>
<p>Guy hung his head and sighed, "What do we do now?"</p>

As a Foundation Establishment mage, the punch appeared to hurtle towards him only at a brisk pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he let down his guard, Wei Zao propelled his left arm for a quick jab right below the liver. Blevin's eyes widened as he saw the fist closing in on him. Although a liver punch wouldn't incapacitate him like a regular person, the problem was that his convergence point happened to fall at a location right where the fist was headed. Usually, he'd be careful in guarding that region. But he became negligent when facing the seemingly weak Wei Zao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jab connected. Blevin hoped that it was just a simple hit, but to his horror, he felt Wei Zao channel his own mana towards that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e'How did he know!' Blevin screamed internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could do anything, he felt the energy leaving his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Blevin cursed his poor luck, Wei Zao reeled back and jabbed at the same point once again while screaming, \"2!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlevin's started to sweat as he anticipated what was about to happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePUNCH \"3!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePUNCH \"4!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePUNCH \"5!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the fifth punch, Blevin summarily evacuated his bowels and fell over into his mess. He couldn't control his body at all. The first two punches were sufficiently cushioned by his superior physique, but the following three struck while his body was powerless. He wanted to cry but couldn't shed any tears because his entire body had shut down at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for the 5 hit head start, Teacher. I am grateful,\" Wei Zao said in a mocking tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incontinent Blevin was so agitated that he started to throw up blood uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow... I never knew that people could actually throw up blood in real life... It doesn't make any anatomical sense...\" Guy muttered as he mused at the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWei Zao casually dusted his clothes and walked towards the wooden box next to the ring, under the sparkling gazes of Gaige and Mai. He picked it up, bowed towards the crowd and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone present slowly dispersed while gossiping about what just happened. The only two people that remained were Guy and Markus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! He just took all the resources! Did he forget about us?\" Guy screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly no one minded him. And those who did hear him channelled the noise through one ear out the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuy hung his head and sighed, \"What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/TGT/notes/TrNjAwSpxqRVk73cuZAA8\"\u003eChapter 023 - Ancient Art of Thigh-Grabbing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBacklinks\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/TGT/notes/abZuubVxzSmXlehhWb3VZ\"\u003eChapter 021 - Wei Zao vs. the First Arrogant Young Master\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n\u003e Word Count:\n\u003e\n\u003e Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\u003e \n\u003e Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"FpDtHwccaznzDrcko3q5T"},"buildId":"ph39nQF1ahHPnyA4smxu1","assetPrefix":"/TGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

<p>Guy wasn't the least bit surprised in learning that dyslexia existed in this magical new world. It was common back on Earth, and Guy figured that since base humans had evolved to a similar stage in this world, certain neurological conditions, developmental disorders, and mental illnesses should also be equally present. What did surprise him, though, was that there were little to no remedies or treatments to those problems in this world? After all, given how magic and mana was commonplace here, it wouldn't be a stretch to expect that there were equally magical treatments for these conditions, disorders, and illnesses.</p>
<p>And yet, reality proved otherwise, because Guy just couldn't glean any solutions through his search. Of course, he was limited to the village and his search would obviously be biased in that sense. Guy really wished that he had access to a library or a repository of some sort catering to medical experts. However, he also realised that without any recommendation or backing, he couldn't access them.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard of such illnesses through my travels," Krish said while tilting his head in trying to recollect information.</p>
<p>Another discovery that surprised Guy, was in finding out that Krish Nara, the man who secured Guy his job as a local tutor, happened to be a veritable powerhouse when it came to information of any kind. No matter how obscure or out-of-the-way the question may be, Krish would have an answer to it. If not, he would provide a suitable direction for research that could lead to a greater understanding of the topic. During his time here, Guy had managed to build rapport with this mysterious man and had formed a certain friendship.</p>
<p>However, 'Friendship' would be a twisted way to put it. The two were friendly and courteous with each other, but under the surface, they were both digging into each other's background and trying to suss out their true purpose.</p>
<p>Guy wanted to know the reason why Krish helped him out earlier. Nothing came for free, and things that usually did had conditions imposed in tiny writing behind a flap of some kind that could easily be overlooked. Was this man related to the original Guy in some way? Did this man have any ulterior motives? Many such questions were circling Guy's head that he wanted immediate answers to. But Guy knew that no good would come with barraging them at Krish. Best case scenario: the man would feel miffed at the intrusion and summarily close himself off. Worst case scenario: the man would rain destruction so terrible that it would wipe this entire village out of the face of this planet. Guy didn't know what kind of backing or power this seemingly weak old man had, and he wasn't looking to experiencing it first hand either. Hence, Guy employed the gentle approach and formed a surface friendship with Krish.</p>
<p>Krish, on the other hand, wanted to know why his Heavenly Eye was telling him that Guy was dead? He wanted to know why the fortune of this village underwent a 180-degree shift within a day? He wanted to know if the two details were related in some way, or if they were all coincidental? Maybe this was a sign that Krish's end was approaching causing his power to fluctuate and act out? Whatever the case may be, the only solution would be to personally investigate the situation. However, he couldn't just tie up Guy and physically squeeze the information out of him!</p>
<p>'I don't do that anymore,' he chuckled internally. His personality had become tempered through his millennium of experience. He had learned that when it came to mortals, it was often the gentle and systematic approach that offered the greatest rewards. Like the old saying went, "One shouldn't use a |Flamestrike| to grill pork." It was best to match the means to the target.</p>
<p>"Really? There have to be some records on this topic. I refuse to believe that no one has ever experienced or seen such problems before!" Guy commented in response.</p>
<p>Krish exhaled loudly through his nose and spoke in ponderance, "I do recollect a case along the same vein. Have you heard of The Soaring Sword Sect?"</p>
<p>Guy shook his head, "I don't think I have."</p>
<p>"During my travels, I once stayed over there. Really wonderful folk, not like most other sects I've been to. They were deep into cultivation of Sword Intent, do you know what that is?"</p>
<p>Guy shook his head again.</p>
<p>"Anyone can wield a sword. It's not a hard thing to do. But it is hard to wield it without hurting yourself. Those that can accomplish that often train for years to become experts in swordsmanship. Amongst those swordsmen, those with potential for magic can train in a series of skills that complement their swordsmanship called Sword Arts. These extend the mortal swordsmanship styles by imbuing and manipulating mana in some particular way. Mages that have mastered multiple Sword Arts, and choose to cultivate their sword skills more deeply, pursue an elusive concept often known as Sword Intent. A mage that can manifest Sword Intent is said to have reached a realm where they become one with the sword and can perform their Sword Arts without needing a physical sword to channel the power. Manifesting Sword Intent is often the step-off point into higher realms in cultivating swordsmanship. And that is exactly what mages in The Soaring Sword Sect pursue with immense fervour. They are so involved in this pursuit that they often seclude themselves from the world for years on end."</p>
<p>Krish paused before continuing, "I say they were wonderful because they seldom interfered in the mortal world unless certain events blatantly offended a set of codes established by their sect ancestors. So anyway, there was this kid, the Sect Leader's latest direct disciples, that had to go on an extermination mission raised by a township that neighboured the sect. With his position and reputation, the kid was extremely arrogant and entitled. He felt that he was above everyone just because the Sect Leader chose him out of 1000 others. He thought the extermination mission was easy and beneath him, yet the Sect Leader pushed him to take it in hopes of tempering the boy's mentality. As you would have guessed, the mission wasn't as easy as the boy figured it to be. He had to confront a large bandit group led by a mage in the same realm as him. The boy went in without planning and peacocked his affiliation. The entire camp attacked him together. Once the minions softened him up, the leader came in for the killing blow.</p>
<p>"But the Sect Leader was keeping an eye the entire time, so he interfered and handled the matter. The boy, though, was thoroughly affected. Coming face to face with his mortality and his inadequacy did a number on him. It completely shattered his ego, developing Inner Demons in the process. The following time he attempted a breakthrough, he suffered a serious backlash and crippled his cultivation."</p>
<p>"Inner Demons?" Guy mimicked.</p>
<p>Krish affirmed with a hum and added, "He became reclusive and started to second guess everything. He was easily irritated, started to drink excessively, constantly exuded an aura of hopelessness, and was always checked out. The Sect Leader didn't know what to do. The boy happened to have a special physique that made him more perceptive to Sword Intent. He was meant to soar the skies as the youngest mage to ever manifest the Sword Intent. In many ways, the Sect Leader felt responsible for how things turned out."</p>
<p>"Wasn't he, though?" Guy asked with a hint of surety, to which Krish denied, "It was a foregone conclusion. An inevitability, if you will. The boy was born with great fortune, but he was doomed to never realise it."</p>
<p>"You must have already seen that, right?"</p>
<p>"I did. And when the Sect Leader asked me about the boy's fortune, I told him about it. It was for that reason that the Sect Leader sent the boy on the mission in the first place! To temper the kid and help him unleash his full potential."</p>
<p>"You must have also seen the boy's descent following his failure."</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"And you didn't warn the Sect Leader?"</p>
<p>Krish smiled mysteriously and answered, "He didn't ask. Mages think that just because they can cultivate beyond mortality and exceed their limits, they can go against their fortune and fate. The reality is far from that. In many ways, the Sect Leader was equally as arrogant as the boy. He thought that just because he had an insight into the future, he could change it. He believed that with his unparalleled strength and wisdom, he could play as a Deity."</p>
<p>Guy smiled bitterly and commented, "It's ironic. There is this saying, 'One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.'"</p>
<p>Krish nodded enthusiastically and said, "That is exactly it! I could tell you your entire future and you could do everything in your power to remedy it. Yet you will still end up in the same place. Life is filled with inevitabilities. It is not our place to mitigate them. All we can do is anticipate them and cushion ourselves as best as we can."</p>
<p>With some hesitation, Guy asked, "So is there really no other way to go against destiny?"</p>
<p>"There is," Krish said in an elongated tone. "You cannot change your own destiny. Only the person who can peer into your destiny can personally step in and change it. But this is dangerous for both yourself and the person." </p>
<p>After a much longer pause, Krish continued, "There is another way, apparently. But it is much, much rarer and till sometime back, was considered impossible."</p>
<p>"And that is?" Guy asked expectantly.</p>
<p>Krish simply smiled and answered, "I don't know yet."</p>
<p>Guy's eyebrows twitched at that. He slowly stood up and said, "Kano should be waking up any time now. I should get going."</p>
<p>Krish smiled and walked Guy out. As Guy turned the corner, he started to ponder about his next course of action.</p>
<p>"Since this world offers no solution, I guess I must revert to what I'm familiar with," he muttered and began walking up the steps to the orphanage.</p>

A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n\u003e Word Count:\n\u003e\n\u003e Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\u003e \n\u003e Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"h7Nn1c5nWjflgxhowWHio"},"buildId":"ph39nQF1ahHPnyA4smxu1","assetPrefix":"/TGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

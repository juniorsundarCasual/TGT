<h2 id="mana-condensation">Mana Condensation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mana-condensation"></a></h2>
<p>Every human has nascent mana well. It is small at first and it can be grown using two main methods. Either using the mana for spells, that push it to its limits or using cultivation methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Early</em> - Can perform cantrips (i.e. non-elementally aligned and simple magic. Does not stress the channels.)</li>
<li><em>Middle</em> - Can perform Tier-1 spells with minimum elemental alignment</li>
<li><em>Late</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Perfected resonance is an indicator that a mage is ready to breakthrough into Foundation Establishment</p>
<h2 id="foundation-establishment">Foundation Establishment<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#foundation-establishment"></a></h2>
<p>To enter Foundation Establishment, one must have a cultivation method that resonates with them in some way. Cultivation methods give insights into their selves that helps them to develop a foundation in a concept or idea that speaks to them and form a Mana Body. People in this stage can perform Tier-2 to Tier-4 spells depending on their capacities (or boosts due to special physiques and bloodlines).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base (Mana Pond)</em> - Reinforcing blood vessels</li>
<li><em>Internal (Mana Lake)</em> - Reinforcing internal organs and skeletal structure</li>
<li><em>External (Mana Sea)</em> - Reinforcing skin, muscles and external organs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-formation">Core Formation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#core-formation"></a></h2>
<p>Forming a core is the first step into transforming the base human into a post-human. Core Formation mages are no longer considered their base species. For beasts, the Core Formation gives them the ability to obtain a new form of their own choosing that aligns with their foundation. Furthermore, metamorphosed species can reproduce with any other species. This gives rise to special bloodlines and special physiques that manifest in full power when the offspring hits Core Formation stage.</p>
<p>Beasts usually have a predetermined and/or fixed metamorphosis lineage. A gryphon can remain a gryphon or morph into an archgryphon (still in the same base line). On the other hand, a snake can morph into a naga (kind of a different species). Humans do not have a prefixed metamorphosis lineage, there is openness here. But due to lack of such a pathway, it is harder for humans to hit Core Formation. Core Formation mages can use Tier-4 to Tier-6 spells, with some special species able to hit Tier-7 of any specific elemental or non-elemental flavoured spells that resonate with their cores.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>First Half (Fold mana sea to form a 3D schematic)</em> - First step in materialising your cultivation. For a fire-centred mage, their blood could be charged with burning characteristics. For a swordsman, they can now infuse the cutting character to stuff.</li>
<li><em>Second Half (Materialise the 3D schematic into functioning skeletal structure)</em> - Not a big jump. Just attained through increased proficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Core can be absorbed from corpse after death, but this isn't a fully material core.</p>
<h2 id="core-condensation">Core Condensation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#core-condensation"></a></h2>
<p>Core Condensation stage is achieved after undergoing a tribulation. These can be physical or mental. The focus of the tribulation is to decipher a weakness in the mage's core and foundation and attack it. If the core destabilises the mage has to start again in making a core. If the foundation destabilises the mage dies</p>
<p>Tribulation is activated when Core Formation mage solidify their skeletal core. This is the point where a core becomes an actual physical organ. To manifest something abstract causes the world itself to rebel, thus the tribulation.</p>
<p>Core condensation has only 1 stage and that is to infuse new insights into the skeletal core to make it into a stronger fully formed self-sustaining 3D structure.</p>
<p>Core condensation mages can user Tier-7 to Tier-8 spells with specialists able to use Tier-9 spells.</p>
<h2 id="tesseract-transformation">Tesseract Transformation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tesseract-transformation"></a></h2>
<p>To enter Tesseract Transformation stage, the core must be shattered and expanded. This process is painful and is a tribulation the mage chooses to do upon themselves.Â </p>
<p>To form a tesseract, the mage must peer into their souls and pull it out of their body and merge it with their cores. This is the end point of cultivation because now the mage has reached liberation.</p>
<p>At this point the mage's physical and magical strength becomes stagnant, but they can advance their souls by performing introspection. As long as the soul is not stagnant, the mage can live to eternity.</p>
<p>Tesseract Transformation experts can perform Tier-9 and above spells.</p>
<h2 id="ascension">Ascension<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ascension"></a></h2>
<p>Mages that no longer want to continue advancing can choose to ascend. This is the process of pulling their tesseracts out of their body and affixing it to a point in the material world.</p>
<p>The point can be an object, an entity, or even an artificially created tear in space to create a mini-realm. This point holds the culmination of the mage's cultivation and can sustain a spectral life of theirs for practically eternity. This point becomes and Inheritance Artefact, since others can use it and gain insight into the original's cultivation.</p>
<h2 id="other-details">Other Details<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#other-details"></a></h2>
<p>Mageâs base age multiplies by 1.5 to 2 every stage until Tesseract Transformation where they are essentially immortal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So for humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana Condensation: 150 - 200 years</li>
<li>Foundation Establishment: 300-400 years</li>
<li>Core Formation: 600-800 years</li>
<li>Core Condensation: 1200-1600 years</li>
<li>Tesseract Transformation: N/A</li>
<li>Ascension: Psychic Immortality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other species have different base age limits so the extension differs. But for those with higher base age limits, advancing is harder.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#mana-condensation" title="Mana Condensation">Mana Condensation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#foundation-establishment" title="Foundation Establishment">Foundation Establishment</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#core-formation" title="Core Formation">Core Formation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#core-condensation" title="Core Condensation">Core Condensation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#tesseract-transformation" title="Tesseract Transformation">Tesseract Transformation</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#ascension" title="Ascension">Ascension</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#other-details" title="Other Details">Other Details</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"J16tCsw9ACm0TjckrSE1A","title":"Cultivation Levels","desc":"","updated":1665079495174,"created":1643658012311,"custom":{},"fname":"miscellaneous.cultivation-levels","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9fbbc7244099238b2a199c0c63af262c","links":[],"anchors":{"mana-condensation":{"type":"header","text":"Mana Condensation","value":"mana-condensation","line":8,"column":0,"depth":2},"foundation-establishment":{"type":"header","text":"Foundation Establishment","value":"foundation-establishment","line":18,"column":0,"depth":2},"core-formation":{"type":"header","text":"Core Formation","value":"core-formation","line":27,"column":0,"depth":2},"core-condensation":{"type":"header","text":"Core Condensation","value":"core-condensation","line":40,"column":0,"depth":2},"tesseract-transformation":{"type":"header","text":"Tesseract Transformation","value":"tesseract-transformation","line":51,"column":0,"depth":2},"ascension":{"type":"header","text":"Ascension","value":"ascension","line":61,"column":0,"depth":2},"other-details":{"type":"header","text":"Other Details","value":"other-details","line":67,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":[],"parent":"fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"cultivation-levels\"\u003eCultivation Levels\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cultivation-levels\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mana-condensation\"\u003eMana Condensation\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#mana-condensation\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery human has nascent mana well.

A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n\u003e Word Count:\n\u003e\n\u003e Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\u003e \n\u003e Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"J16tCsw9ACm0TjckrSE1A"},"buildId":"ph39nQF1ahHPnyA4smxu1","assetPrefix":"/TGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

Socratic seminars were fun, Markus admitted. Although the set-up took a fair bit of work on his end, the actual seminar was self-driving. All he had to do was sit aside and focus on the direction the discussion was moving. If said discussion moved off-topic or lost momentum, he had to step in and reignite things. But otherwise, things were mostly hands-off. Markus liked that a lot as it introduced a new dynamic to every lesson.

Before, as he acted as the lecturer and taught lessons through the standard teaching process, he'd created a distance between himself and his peers. It was an awkward dynamic, to be honest, since they were basically the same age, yet people talked to him like he was some old person. It also extended outside the classroom. For instance, if he entered the mess hall or the recreation rooms, the lively conversations that were running on inside would all cease immediately and turn all hush-hush. The only people he could talk to openly was Marie, and Furion (though his visits to the Sect were infrequent nowadays). Even Jean spoke to him with reverence!

But the Socratic seminar seamlessly bridged that gap. Within just two sessions, Markus found himself arguing and debating amongst.

"The Second Law of Thermodynamics isn't a suggestion!" Revian evoked. "It's an absolute fact that governs the way the world behaves! There is no way you can make a cold room even colder without external work."

Markus nodded his head vigorously and proposed, "But what constitutes work? Would spells or enchantments count as work? How does mana play a role in calculating entropy? Standard definitions describe work to occer in the interaction between the compressor, evaporator and the condenser. These are mechanical systems. If we were to replace this with magical systems, how would the definition change?"

"That..." Revian had no response.

"I guess that's something for all of us to think about, huh?" Markus said to everyone else in the circle. "Revian makes a good point here. There are a lot of rules and laws in the natural world that fall apart when mana is brought into the picture. It is in that grey area that we mages operate. Magic introduces chaos, and it falls on use to make sense of it and control it."

Markus looked back at Revian, who was still in deep thought, "Let's end today's seminar. Oh, and Revian! Can I have a word?"

Revian's head jolted in response, and he let out short nods in acquiescence. After the class cleared up, Markus approached Revian and asked, "What's the problem? You seem a little troubled."

"It's as you said," Revian admitted with a long and tired exhale. "The science makes sense, but the magic doesn't. I just don't know why."

"It's because you can prove science, but not magic," Markus responded with an understanding hum. "I struggled a lot with it as well. Let me use myself as an example here - gravity makes sense mathematically and physically, but its application in magic is most nonsensical. You've never had the opportunity to bask in the magic of an Abyssal Wyrm, so you will never know, but their rendition of gravity in spell form makes absolute zero sense."

"Yet you succeeded!" Revian chimed in, with a hopeful glint in his eyes.

"I did, but my understanding isn't the same as an Abyssal Wyrm's. And to be frank, it doesn't have to be. A Polar Beorn actually blows the Second Law of Thermodynamics out of the water, as its mere presence chills a room. But where does the heat go?" Markus highlighted. "Just as gravity comes naturally to an Abyssal Wyrm, refrigeration comes naturally to a Polar Beorn. Unfortunately for us average folk, we don't have the luxury of such natural affinities. So, we have to make do with other pathways."

"Like what?" Revian responded, expecting an answer that Markus just did not have.

"That's for you to figure out," Markus said with a shrug.

Revian clicked his tongue in annoyance and quickly wished Markus goodbye.

Revian did not like Socratic seminars when they first started. He liked the old classes, where he was told what was what, and what needed to be done. Things were simpler. The seminars, though, were anything but. There was a lot of self preparation that needed to be done before a seminar - a lot of texts to read and understand. And on top of that, he had to discuss and debate his understanding with his peers. Even though it was a judgement free zone, Revian felt humiliated every time someone corrected him or pointed out a misunderstanding.

'How could I make such a silly mistake?!' He would think. People would now make fun of him... internally. But over time, he realised something. He wasn't alone on this boat - everyone else was going through the same thing. Everyone makes mistakes, which was also why no one judged his errors (not even Markus who led the seminars). In the end, it became a learning opportunity. People tend to remember their failures more than their successes. So knowing exactly when and why he failed allowed Revian to internalise concepts more easily.

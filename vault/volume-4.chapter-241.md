Guy never thought that he'd miss the warm embrace of a down filled mattress and pillow until his head touched and regressed into its marshmallow like softness at one of the many guest rooms in the Rasmus Mansion. His entire body melted into the accommodating support of the mattress, until he became one with the damn thing. At that moment, Guy anguished over his advancement into the Foundation Establishment realm. Though he wasn't fully liberated from the need to sleep, it wasn't a daily pressing matter for him any more - he only slept about twice a week for eight hours each, on a good week. Sometimes he could go for two weeks with eight to ten. Nonetheless, sleep was evading him like a coy girl playing hard to get.

'Such misogynistic thoughts...' Guy chided himself. 'Look at what you've turned me into!' Guy blamed while pointing at his pillow with a scandalised gasp.

And thus he remained, staring aimlessly at the ceiling. For the first time in a while, Guy felt like doing nothing at all and just lay there in the bed for a week, maybe a month, possibly a year. A dangerous thought, but one which Guy felt he was deserving of.

Guy cast a net backwards in time, and inspected his life leading up to this point. As he did so, something became clear to him. The only instant where he'd rested his mind, that is to say he did absolutely nothing productive and simply let his mind stagnate, was within the last four hours leading up to his death and the incalculable amount of time afterwards where he was floating around in the void.

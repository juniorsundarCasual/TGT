Two individuals were undergoing breakthroughs in their cultivation in the wrecked clearing in the woods. One was a teen girl and the other was an adult male. The former was breaking through from Mana Condensation into the Foundation Establishment realm while the latter was taking a step out of Foundation Establishment into Core Formation. Both transitions were monumentous in nature as one person was taking her first true step into the math of magehood and potential immortality, while the other was reforging his physical form to one that fit his truest perception of himself.

Of the two, though, Jean's advancement was one with the greatest amount of turbulence since it wasn't completely organic in nature.

Unfortunately, Jean could not flush them out either since it would destablise the inflowing cultivation. She had to somehow integrate all of this without contaminating her morals. Fortunately for her, she was in an environment conducive to this - Church of the True World. Conflicts in insights could be reevaluated, edited, or even omitted safely with minimal after-effects.

After perusing through the insights, Jean realised that the creature had actually been gifted with knowledge beyond its capacity. There was information about synthesising illnesses of different sorts not just the viral vectors the creature was relying on. Fortunately, the creature wasn't knowledgeable enough about the topic and was using its abilities like a crude hammer, instead of using it like a scalpel as it was actually intended, an intention the Jean surmised based on the sheer depth and breadth of knowledge (most of which had dissipated from unuse). Jean continually scrubbed away the

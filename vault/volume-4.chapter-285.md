It was a glorius feeling to save a person from the brink of death. The hitherto unnamed plague (epidemic, disease, what-have-you) was a guaranteed death warrant the moment it was contracted, and its symptoms became apparent. However, this was debunked within seconds of the "cure" entering the bloodstream of the man who exhibited symptoms recently and retched all over Kili.

After Josie, performed the ritual (which Jean couldn't follow), the half-litre container of crimson-red blood reduced to a mere droplet of highly luminescent, but clear, liquid. This liquid was carefully diluted with an inert solvent and injected incrementally into the infected man's veins. Within seconds of the medicine reaching the man's heart, his body started to exhibit changes at an unbelievable pace. First came the brightening of the skin - the paleness grew more saturated as if colour was suddenly injected into it. The boils and rashes that were forming exploded, and the pus boiled away completely. The emaciation, however, started to grow direr which implied that the body was eating itself to sustain its healing. This was solved by dissolving a bar of concetrated nutrition into water and feeding it to the man by the spoonful. The bar was developed to maximise metabolism in the short-term, so there was no concern of the rate of healing outpacing the body's ability to replenish itself.

At the sight of this recovery, Jean should be feeling elated, exuberant, positively drowning in euphoric satisfaction. Yet none of those emotions surfaced on her mien, partly because she was physically unable to portray them, and partly because she couldn't find herself to feel positively about the situation at all. Not when there was a pale, anemic girl laying on a bed two tents away. This recovery came with a steep cost of blood.

Even with the special physique, Jean was certain that constantly draining blood from a growing child would not be helpful, especially since she was mortal and the full extent of the physique had yet to rear itself. Sure, she could feed her placebos and convincing the girl that it was blood replenishing draughts, but every power had limits, overdrawing which would come back to hurt the individual either immediately or years down the line.

Death now, or in the future. This was the problem Jean had to face when considering the alternatives to Kili's current predicament. The disease needed to be cured, and people needed to be saved. This was a foregone conclusion. Yet the "how" of the process was out of Jean's hands. Kili was the solution, but Jean was apprehensive about exploiting the girl as she was doing at the moment. She could contract the Rasmus Clan's industrial level alchemical services to reproduce the cure (which is essentially the girl's blood distilled to only contain her "essence") but this process would put the girl in danger of exploitation by someone more powerful. A safer alternate would be to wait, so that Jean could double down on alchemical research and possibly device a more efficient way to Deconstruct and Synthesise using principles of chemistry, but Jean could not guarantee completion before the illness wiped out an entire swatch of land of all mortal life.

Jean returned to the tent she designated for personal research and treated the exhausted Kili with an infusion of a potion brewed from crush petals of the Enduring Lotus. It would replenish her blood quickly in conjunction with the girl's naturally adaptive physiological capacity. And then, as she stared blankly at the girl's chest undulating periodically with each breath passed, she thought about her next step.

The cure didn't just save one person, it reignited the hopes in the hearts of everyone in the camp. This was augmented by the fact that the recovery was immediate and potent (the man had taken a few steps in view of a small crowd as well). The fact that there was light at the end of the dark tunnel caused a marked increase in morale in the camp - a positive mental attitude went a long way towards healing. But this was also a double-edged sword, since hope garnered expectation, and the folks expected Jean to cure the others who were starting to show symptoms.

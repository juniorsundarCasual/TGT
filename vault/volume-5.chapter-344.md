"Do you think we'll achieve a breakthrough?"

"Why not? Shuri did it, why can't we?"

"I mean, its kind of different with her, right? She has... a background (for the lack of a better word). She has the magical techniques and cultivation methods from her family that helped her in this."

"But it was all worth naught until she became a part of the True World Sect," "It must mean something!"

"Besides, she's smart and capable. I don't I can match that."

"We don't have to rush. Sect Leader Larks said that finding our pace is key. Doesn't Senior Brother Markus say it all the time? 'Talent can give you a leg up, but it isn't anything that can't be bridged with the right amount of hard work.'"

"Sounds like a load of copium if you ask me."

"What in the world is that?"

"Didn't you see Huron's most recent comic?"

"He's talking about the one with the anthropomorphic frog locking himself in a room filled with an incense burner labelled copium. It's a play on the word opium, and how the drug is used to escape reality. You imbibe copium to ignore or downplay the severity of a problem by relying on overly optimistic beliefs."

"Wow! Huron's works have been becoming increasingly abstract ever since Senior Sister Jean left for her trip. It's like he isn't trying at all."

"Any way, what we really need to break through is inspiration - something that we can dig deep into and internalise."

"It can't be THAT easy!"

"It isn't. Didn't you hear a word Senior Brother Markus said in last week's 'Theory of Cultivation'?"

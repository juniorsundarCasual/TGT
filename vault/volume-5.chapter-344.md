There was no shortage of recreational activities in the True World Sect. The members were generally encouraged to partake in a round of fun daily, since according to the Sect Leader, "All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy." No one knew who Jack was - the pioneer who spearheaded the daily recreation initiative - but everyone was overwhelmingly grateful for his contribution.

The True World Sect's recreational hall and sports fields catered to all imaginable forms of entertainment one could think of. You could spend hours exerting yourself physically with the myriad of sports options like handball, football, and volleyball, or mentally with the plethora of board games and table-top games.

In fact, those weren't the only options available. The Sect encouraged its members to be creative and encouraged the development of new recreational activities that could help refresh a bogged down mind. One of the results of this initiative was the game of Hover-Sack. It was a game devised by the twins Casey and Lacey, and it involves kicking a small bag filled with sand - barely the size of a closed fist - and stopping it from touching the ground for as long as possible. It is less a competitive sport and more about teamwork, coordination and overall "coolness" as flashy passes, awesome manoeuvring, and extraordinary recoveries are encouraged.

The game didn't require much space to play, was fairly simple to participate in, and didn't have stringent requirements (all you needed was the sack), thus it quickly spread within the Sect. Nowadays, most members walked around with a Hover-Sack in their jacket pockets so that they could challenge other idle members to an impromptu game of Hover-Sack in the wild.

On this particular day, which happened to be the day after Shuri's breakthrough celebration, four members of the True World Sect were playing a rather long game of Hover-Sack with intense focus and gusto.

"Do you think we'll ever achieve a breakthrough?" Revian pondered as he skilfully tapped the sack with his heel, sending it diagonally to the recipient standing opposite him, Kevan.

"Why not? Shuri did it, why can't we?" Kevan answered a second later, catching the sack with his knee and letting it drop to his ankle, where he held it for a beat. He passed the sack to his other leg and sent it to his right, to Lacey. The girl received the ball with a stoic expression, expertly catching it with the back of her right heel and yanking it backwards, causing it to follow a parabolic path from over her hand and landing at her prepared left angle in front of her.

Revian looked towards Casey to his left, who was ready to receive her sister's pass and said, "I mean, its kind of different with her, right? She has... a background (for the lack of a better word). She has the magical techniques and cultivation methods from her family that helped her in this."

"But it was all worth squat until she became a part of the True World Sect," Casey interjected while handling the sack. Three taps later, it was on its way to Revian, "It must mean something!"

Revian grimaced as the sack followed a low trajectory, and squatted to catch it before it hit the ground. 

"Besides, she's smart and capable. I don't I can match that," he added before passing to Lacey to his right - his cheeks blushed lightly as he said this.

Kevan shook his head and reminded, "We don't have to rush. Sect Leader Larks said that finding our pace is key. Doesn't Senior Brother Markus say it all the time? 'Talent can give you a leg up, but it isn't anything that can't be bridged with the right amount of hard work.'"

"Sounds like a load of copium if you ask me," Lacey expressed before doing a backflip and sending the sack high up into the air.

"What in the world is that?" Kevan shot back in confusion, though his attention was trained on the sack returning from the peak of its trajectory.

"Didn't you see Huron's most recent comic?" Lacey responded while scratching her head.

"She's talking about the one with the anthropomorphic frog locking himself in a room filled with an incense burner labelled copium," Revian explained. "It's a play on the word opium, and how the drug is used to escape reality. You imbibe copium to ignore or downplay the severity of a problem by relying on overly optimistic beliefs."

Kevan let out a small celebration as the sack landed successfully on his left knee, which he transitioned into a three-tap manouvre, "Wow! Huron's works have been becoming increasingly abstract ever since Senior Sister Jean left for her trip. It's like he isn't trying at all."

After a simple pass to Casey on his right, he pointed out, "Any way, what we really need to break through is inspiration - something that we can dig deep into and internalise."

"It can't be THAT easy!" Revian challenged, which was affirmed by the sisters who nodded along.

Kevan snorted, expressing light scorn, before saying, "It isn't. Didn't you hear a word Senior Brother Markus said in last week's 'Theory of Cultivation'?"

"I didn't! I had food poisoning and was bedridden for the whole week! It was horrible!"

"Oh shit! *cough* I mean, how did that happen?"

"My parents sent me some homemade delicacies from our hometown. Turns out, we cannot substitute the Red Mint from our town with the local variant..."

"I hope you aren't talking about the Incontinentia Plant, when Matron Reva uses to make laxatives..."

"My parent's didn't know about the plant's side effect when you heat it and extract its oils! Luckily they didn't eat any of the delicacy, or else all that would remain of them would be dried husks."

"But the dosage shouldn't be high enough to cause you such problems. After all, you're in the Middle Stage of Mana Condensation realm."

"My mother lost her sense of smell some time back... Our food is either bland or heavily flavoured - there is no middle ground."

"God damn! Just how much of the Plant did she use?"

"The Plant only faintly smells of mint. So she added it until she smelt the equivalent of ten mint leaves."

"My goodness! That's at least ten entire Incontinentia Plants!"

"More like twenty... My mom's condition..."

"How the hell are you able to walk and sit?!"

"It was embarrassing, man! I lost all control of my anus and kept leaking all over the place."

"Can we please stop talking about this shit *cough* I mean, can we get back to the important matter"

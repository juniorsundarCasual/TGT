Guy digested this startling revelation slowly. Although he knew that the underlying purpose for his transmigration was to help elevate this world and eventually give it a fighting chance against an enigmatic invader, he did not realise the magnitude of the entity he was supposed to put up a fight against. These were creatures capable of decimating universes in their entirety. What was one man like him supposed to do to combat that?

It appeared as though Wei Zao was holding the same thought and said, "How am I supposed to defeat this... THING?!"

[You cannot,] Tron declared. [The probabilities are completely against you. I have run over 1,000,000,000,000 simulations and in 999,999,999,999 of them you lose.]

"So there is 1?" Guy intercepted.

[Nothing is truly impossible. That is one of the laws of every stable world. To account for the random chance of something outside standard happening we have to leave that singular instance untouched. It is purely a ceremonial victory. I cannot tell you the exact steps you need to take in order to achieve that victory,] Tron responded.



Guy points out the simliarity to that IP, OC says that probabilistically, every dream a person has ever had exists out there in the infinite tapestry of worlds.

OC talks about how the invader is a parasite. He is known to have destroyed over ten worlds, which is a lot.

All OC knows is that the nature of the attack is never similar in theme, but the process is common. To slowly pull the entities originally in the source world into the parasite world and having them die there so that their souls gets pulled out of circulation. This way the source world will become exhausted of world energy.

He then says that his world will soon succumb even though he is trying his best to stop the invasion. The other wisps say that once that happens their world will follow.

Wei Zao bursts out saying that they will beat them.

OC says that it is impossible. He is fighting against a world not another entity, and that hubris will be his downfall.

He then says that he is willing to entertain the experiment going on. Since although the world is doomed to death, a fraction of a fraction of a probability exists that the world can be saved with their intervention. He says they can go on doing all they want knowing what exists at the finish line.

He then warns them that the invasion can occur at any time, tomorrow or even centuries later, as time is not a state of existence for World Creators.

Wei Zao proposes an alliance with Guy, saying that he is aware of Guy's presence at the True World Sect.

Guy responds likewise saying that he knows of Teacher Jo Way, and that they used to be acquaintances at the Radiant Academy, causing Wei Zao to sputter in shock.

Guy takes a moment to ponder and then recognises that an alliance would be suitable.

The duo are then ejected back into their bodies.

Guy looks up and sees a world tear hitting the woods.

Grace exclaims that the kids are there.

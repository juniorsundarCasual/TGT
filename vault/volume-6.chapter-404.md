Guy digested this startling revelation slowly. Although he knew that the underlying purpose for his transmigration was to help elevate this world and eventually give it a fighting chance against an enigmatic invader, he did not realise the magnitude of the entity he was supposed to put up a fight against. These were creatures capable of decimating universes in their entirety. What was one man like him supposed to do to combat that?

It appeared as though Wei Zao was holding the same thought and said, "How am I supposed to defeat this... THING?!"

[You cannot,] Tron declared. [The probabilities are completely against you. I have run over 1,000,000,000,000 simulations and in 999,999,999,999 of them you lose.]

"So there is 1?" Guy intercepted.

[Nothing is truly impossible. That is one of the laws of every stable world. To account for the random chance of something outside standard happening we have to leave that singular instance untouched. It is purely a ceremonial victory. I cannot tell you the exact steps you need to take in order to achieve that victory,] Tron responded.

"So what even is the point?" Wei Zao snapped back. "Why was I even brought here? Clearly, it wasn't because I was being given a second chance. But again, how am I supposed to defeat whatever that was? A world much, much more advanced that this one failed to hold out against the invasion. How does this one stand a chance?"

Wei Zao suddenly squatted and started to breath heavily, his eyes bursting out of their sockets. Even in the ethereal (non-physical) state, the man was succumbing to a panic attack.

(I ran a simulation and realised that the 1 out of the 1,000,000,000,000 scenario is only accessible if we introduce a variable that isn't originally present in the system. To put it in simpler terms, all the 999,999,999,999 incidents that failed did not have an entity in it that had the knowledge of the threat and the mechanism by which the threat attacks the world.)

"So you're saying that because we as transmigrants have knowledge of the enemy, we possibly stand in a branch of the probability tree that could potentially lead to a win?" Guy rephrased, while eyeing Wei Zao who was slowly calming down.

(That is correct. To know the enemy means that the battle is already half won,) Mast affirmed.

"It can't be that trivial," Guy negated.

{Although we exist in higher dimension, world builders are rather predictable entities,} Moni joined in. {Our behaviour can be mapped through logical probabilistic reasoning. It makes us boring. The souls that exist in the worlds we build, however, live rather vibrantly. Their decisions don't follow logic all the time. Sometimes, I've seen people choose the world possible option out of handful of choices just because they either wanted it really bad. To us, sentient creatures offer a level of unpredictability that is unmappable. There is beauty in that chaos. And Mast and I believe that this beautiful chaos will give us a fighting chance against this invader.}

[Though I do not agree,] Tron interjected. [But I have agreed to participate in this experiment because there is literally nothing left for me to lose.]

"I-I can't do this," Wei Zao finally blurted out. "This is impossible- It's literally a suicide mission."

{If you cannot do this, then there is no reason for you to stay in this world anymore,} Moni stated blankly. {Prepare to relinquish your body and soul-}

"Wait, what?! Are you going to kill me?"

{You were already dead,} Moni corrected. {Think of it like moving memory out of storage and into a buffer. I'm now just applying everything in the buffer.}

"Regardless of how you sugar-coat it, the 

Guy points out the simliarity to that IP, OC says that probabilistically, every dream a person has ever had exists out there in the infinite tapestry of worlds.

OC talks about how the invader is a parasite. He is known to have destroyed over ten worlds, which is a lot.

All OC knows is that the nature of the attack is never similar in theme, but the process is common. To slowly pull the entities originally in the source world into the parasite world and having them die there so that their souls gets pulled out of circulation. This way the source world will become exhausted of world energy.

He then says that his world will soon succumb even though he is trying his best to stop the invasion. The other wisps say that once that happens their world will follow.

Wei Zao bursts out saying that they will beat them.

OC says that it is impossible. He is fighting against a world not another entity, and that hubris will be his downfall.

He then says that he is willing to entertain the experiment going on. Since although the world is doomed to death, a fraction of a fraction of a probability exists that the world can be saved with their intervention. He says they can go on doing all they want knowing what exists at the finish line.

He then warns them that the invasion can occur at any time, tomorrow or even centuries later, as time is not a state of existence for World Builders.

Wei Zao proposes an alliance with Guy, saying that he is aware of Guy's presence at the True World Sect.

Guy responds likewise saying that he knows of Teacher Jo Way, and that they used to be acquaintances at the Radiant Academy, causing Wei Zao to sputter in shock.

Guy takes a moment to ponder and then recognises that an alliance would be suitable.

The duo are then ejected back into their bodies.

Guy looks up and sees a world tear hitting the woods.

Grace exclaims that the kids are there.

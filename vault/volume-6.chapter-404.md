Guy points out the simliarity to that IP, OC says that probabilistically, every dream a person has ever had exists out there in the infinite tapestry of worlds.

OC talks about how the invader is a parasite. He is known to have destroyed over ten worlds, which is a lot.

All OC knows is that the nature of the attack is never similar in theme, but the process is common. To slowly pull the entities originally in the source world into the parasite world and having them die there so that their souls gets pulled out of circulation. This way the source world will become exhausted of world energy.

He then says that his world will soon succumb even though he is trying his best to stop the invasion. The other wisps say that once that happens their world will follow.

Wei Zao bursts out saying that they will beat them.

OC says that it is impossible. He is fighting against a world not another entity, and that hubris will be his downfall.

He then says that he is willing to entertain the experiment going on. Since although the world is doomed to death, a fraction of a fraction of a probability exists that the world can be saved with their intervention. He says they can go on doing all they want knowing what exists at the finish line.

He then warns them that the invasion can occur at any time, tomorrow or even centuries later, as time is not a state of existence for World Creators.

Wei Zao proposes an alliance with Guy, saying that he is aware of Guy's presence at the True World Sect.

Guy responds likewise saying that he knows of Teacher Jo Way, and that they used to be acquaintances at the Radiant Academy, causing Wei Zao to sputter in shock.

Guy takes a moment to ponder and then recognises that an alliance would be suitable.

The duo are then ejected back into their bodies.

Guy looks up and sees a world tear hitting the woods.

Grace exclaims that the kids are there.

The interview offered Shuri more insight that she could have imagined. In fact, after understanding and internalising all the information provided by Yohn as well as the secondary research she did on the side, the amount of noise in her perturbed min reduced significantly. At this point, there were only a few ideas and concepts floating about in there, each just as viable as the other.

The essence of creation lies in fulfilling needs or wants. While there may be instances where individuals create simply for the joy of it, more often than not, the impetus behind creation is self-oriented. However, the journey of a creation borne solely from inspiration and an inner drive faces a great challenge in gaining widespread acceptance within the mass market. While it might resonate with a niche audience, it seldom extends beyond those boundaries.

Certainly, one could employ ingenious marketing strategies to artificially generate demand, but this approach could be deemed as deceitful since the product itself lacks the persuasive power. Consequently, the crux of designing a successful product resides in thorough market research and a profound understanding of the target audience whose needs and wants it seeks to fulfil.

Shuri's cultivation was quick to assimilate this insight.

He core proposed that, "The purpose of automation is to make life easier for human beings."

Additionally, "The essence of creation lies in fulfilling needs or wants."

Creation. Automation. The unity of those two concepts caused her cultivation to bubble slightly. Riding the high that came with it, Shuri pulled out a stack of parchment and started to draw out the designs that made the most sense to her.

For the first idea, Shuri decided to go with something simple. She drew inspiration from the grimoire that Senior Brother Markus carried around with him. Basically, she envisioned a mana core with all the possible modules programmed into it. Adding new spells to the list would require integrating new commands that would mix and match the modules already etched into it. The mana core would hold all the spells categorised by the primary modules and functions, that the user can navigate through in the form of a menu that is presented in Braille. To cast a spell, they would have to work through the menu or user-interface in Braille, to find the spell they wanted. It was a very straightforward solution, but not one that was particularly exciting. Shuri created a simple sketch with label and quickly moved the parchment aside as she didn't feel motivated to continue working on this one.

The second idea came in the form of a gesture-based wand. Basically, the programmed core would be held in one hand. The user would then move the core in a particular way, which would elicit a haptic response from the core indicating that a specific gesture was initiated. By chaining these different movements, they can create a modular spell. Shuri started creating concept artwork that could represent this new magic wand, filling up the entire A3-sized with drawings and labelling text. Once that was complete, she swiftly moved the parchment away and started to sketch her third idea.

This one was along the same lines as the second, in that it involved gestures and haptic feedback, but she decided to go bigger with this one. Basically, this design would use a core that projects a field immediately in front of a person, essentially encompassing a 50-by-50 square-centimetre area in front of their chest. In this region, the user can flash hand signs, which the programmed core would recognise and respond with haptic feedback indicating that a specific gesture, corresponding to a specific module, was added to a chain. This idea was partly inspired by another literature in the library on sign-language for the deaf-and-dumb.

The fourth idea went a slightly different direction. While the previous two relied on large movements performed by the user, this one focused more on subtlety. Shuri was inspired by the nigh endless permutations offered by the Rubik's cube, and considered a case where the wand and the cube could be integrated. She already knew that training muscle memory was a matter of practice and repetition. What if she could leverage this, with the haptic adaptability of the visually-impaired, to create a combination based wand? Basically, the core would be housed within some sort of combination structure, akin to a Rubik's Cube. The method of casting spells would be to position the cube in specific permutations and orientations. To make it accessible for the blind, Braille would be included in the design in a way that identifying orientations would simply be a matter of rubbing the fingers over the sides (analogous to looking and checking). This was an idea that motivated a lot of sketches, requiring an additional piece of parchment.

As Shuri's inventive mind continued to explore the realm of possibilities, she found herself entwined with a cluster of ideas that bore similarities to those she had already sketched. These lingering concepts, while not straying far from her initial inspirations, carried distinct nuances that warranted further exploration. Recognizing their potential value, she resolved to weave them into her repertoire of designs as appendices or alternate concepts, enriching the array of solutions.

One such idea mirrored the essence of her first concept - the simplicity of an interactive tablet equipped with buttons that emulated the functionality of grimoire-type solution. In this alternative approach, users could interact with the tablet's touch-sensitive surface, each button representing a specific geometric module within the spell circle. By tapping or pressing these buttons in sequence, the user could build a modular spell with ease. The tablet's user-interface, thoughtfully designed in Braille, enabled tactile navigation through the list of available spells.

The entire ideation step stretched until dinner, at which point Shuri decided to stop. First, because she felt that this was a good point to end the ideation stage. She didn't think there were any more ideas left for her to explore and evaluate. She felt that she was just digging the same hole over and over again at this point. Secondly, she didn't want to get into trouble with Matron Reva again for missing an important meal. Although she no longer felt the urge to eat like before, sustenance was still a minor requirement. Besides, she no longer had to worry about getting fat or messing her figure as she could just burn away the excess fat with her improved body control.

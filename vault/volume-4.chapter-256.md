After Marie was left to her devices in the vault beneath the mountain, she immediately started to cycle through plates one after the other, gaping in awe at the convenience and ingenuity of the whole infrastructure. In this process, she discovered a few more features that Mage Maddi had left out in her explanation. For instance, it was possible to expand a select region of the three-dimensional projected by a significant factor. Marie decided to dub this behaviour as the 'zoom' function, since it felt as if she was zooming into the sky while approaching the desired region. She noted that she was able to zoom in by at least a hundred times without losing clarity.

Though she did not have access to the exact method used to develop this magical piece of technology, it didn't stop her from developing theories and hypotheses regarding its internal mechanism and concepts at play. For one, the mode of capturing the visual of the sky. Through repeated zoom-ins and zoom-outs, some beyond the limits of the system's capacity, she found that the projection was basically a collection of points assigned a colour as well as a relative frame with respect to a reference point (which would be the projection quadropod). The total number of points projected never exceeded a fixed amount of 298598400 give or take a few. As she zoomed in, the existing points moved apart and new ones spawned to take their place so that it didn't look like an empty void was suddenly spawned at the centre of a star. And this continued until the maximum zoom-in limit where Marie theorised that no new point could be spawned to fill in the blanks.

Marie also noted that the regions in the far reaches of outer space, corresponding to the empty regions between celestial bodies, were actually artificially spawned points of true black. She determined their artificial nature by the fact that they never jittered as a result of noise (terrain, sensing, etc.) when she zoomed in.

The physics of how this system worked did baffle her for a while. With her limited understanding of the subject, she figured that maybe some sort of emission, reflection and absorption mechanism was in play here. Where the pylons emitted some kind of wave or particle, allowed it to reflect off of a surface while capturing key features at that point such as its colour and distance from source, and retrieved this information by absorbing the reflection. 

In the Solar System that Gaea was a part of, there were six other planets besides it. Starting from the Sun, it went Duenea, Norvea, Gaea, Thorea, Uthea, Gradinea and Sacagea. She knew for a fact, having read this detail in an old book during her travels, that the distances between Gaea and Sacagea was appreciable - approximately 25 G-Units (which is the average distance from the Sun to Gaea). The fact that she could sometimes see Sacagea in the three-dimensional visuals, which was 25 times as far away from the Sun as Gaea, at around the size of a large ball even at the maximum zoomed-in level, established an upper limit to how far the pylons could see and capture. She could see the other planets as well, and with increasing detail as you worked your way closer to Gaea. In fact, the representation even captured the surface of Duenea, Norvea and Thorea with detail matching if the person was actually there!

After messing around a bit more with the device, the euphoria brought on by exposure to its new and innovative magic and technology started to wear off. As she sobered up, her expression started to droop more and more until she was forced to sit down on the group and ponder over her next move.

The data she was working with was raw. Unadulterated, unaltered, raw. She wanted to know the configuration of celestial bodies in space, and she got just that. Except it reached just short of making any sense of what information was gathered.

How does one define the position of celestial bodies? What is the frame of reference that is most apt?

The next set of questions tackled higher level probleems, such as: "How much needs to be considered to define the correct model? Should constellations and clusters visible in the night sky be considered as part of the model as well?"

Especially with the last question, Marie found that with each new celestial body taken into consideration for the model, she would be introducing an additional set of parameters and a whole other equation. Planetary dynamics was already highly nonlinear, this would just make it a hundred times worse.

After taking half an hour to sit in silence, meditate and plan out her next move.

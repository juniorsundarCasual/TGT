After Marie was left to her devices in the vault beneath the mountain, she immediately started to cycle through plates one after the other, gaping in awe at the convenience and ingenuity of the whole infrastructure. In this process, she discovered a few more features that Mage Maddi had left out in her explanation. For instance, it was possible to expand a select region of the three-dimensional projected by a significant factor. Marie decided to dub this behaviour as the 'zoom' function, since it felt as if she was zooming into the night sky while approaching the desired region. She noted that she was able to zoom in by at least a hundred times without losing clarity.

Though she did not have access to the exact method used to develop this magical piece of technology, it didn't stop her from developing theories and hypotheses regarding its internal mechanism and concepts at play. For one, the mode of capturing the visual of the night sky. Through repeated zoom-ins and zoom-outs, some beyond the limits of the system's capacity, she found that the projection was basically a collection of points assigned a colour as well as a relative frame with respect to a reference point (which would be the projection quadropod). The total number of points projected never exceeded a fixed amount of 298598400 give or take a few. As she zoomed in, the existing points moved apart and new ones spawned to take their place so that it didn't look like an empty void was suddenly spawned at the centre of a star. And this continued until the maximum zoom-in limit where Marie theorised that no new point could be spawned to fill in the blanks.

Marie also noted that the regions in the far reaches of outer space, corresponding to the darkest parts of the night sky, were actually artificially spawned points of true black. She determined their fakeness by the fact that they never jittered as a result of noise (terrain, sensing, etc.) when she zoomed in.

After the euphoria brought on by exposure to new and innovative magic and technology wore

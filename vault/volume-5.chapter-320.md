Shuri stood before the overbearing doors that would lead into her inevitable execution room with her workbooks in her left hand and the faintly luminous mana core in her right. She took a moment to mentally ticked off one the last two items in her "do not do's" (the last one was so taboo that she didn't even want to think about it). She also took another moment to cross out every single plan and scheme she'd formulated while coming to this Sect. Her means of escape had all but closed. She thought herself a wolf in sheep-clothing, ready to take what she desired and escape before the shepherd caught her. But turns out, she was just one of the sheep all along, who'd just been fooled into believing she was a wolf in sheep-clothing.

'And just like any sheep, once I have outlived my necessity, I will be culled,' Shuri concluded. As she did so, she raised the ball in her palms and looked at it with a penseive expression.

Shuri stood before the overbearing doors that would lead into her inevitable execution room with her workbooks in her left hand and the faintly luminous mana core in her right. She took a moment to mentally ticked off one the last two items in her "do not do's" (the last one was so taboo that she didn't even want to think about it). She also took another moment to cross out every single plan and scheme she'd formulated while coming to this Sect. Her means of escape had all but closed. She thought herself a wolf in sheep-clothing, ready to take what she desired and escape before the shepherd caught her. But turns out, she was just one of the sheep all along, who'd just been fooled into believing she was a wolf in sheep-clothing.

'And just like any sheep, once I have outlived my necessity, I will be culled,' Shuri concluded. As she did so, she raised the ball in her palms and looked at it with a pensive expression. She was a hundred-percent certain that her appointment today was about this curious creation in her hand. Shuri knew that her attempt to manifest the Yoruz Clan's magical-automation successfully would attract the attention of those above.

But, as long as Shuri could prove her value - she could turn herself so crucial to the Sect through her contributions and presence that it would become impossible to remove her without incurring significant backlash. This would be possible over time, once she mastered everything her mother's clan had to offer and released a few products integrating those skills. In fact, she could even spin the whole debacle with the Lowe's acquisition into her favour this way.

Unfortunately though, her timeline was pulled forward by years, and she had yet to build her value for the Sect.

"You can come in, you know," the magnetic baritone called from accross the closed door. "You've been standing there for a while!"

Shuri contained her embarrassment as best as she could, although the increasing rose tint on her cheeks kept growing mover vivid. She coughed and opened the door, "Good morning, Sect Leader Larks."

As she was about to bow, she suddenly felt an opposition stopping her from dipping lower.

"As I've said, there is no need for all that formality," the man reminded as he waved his hand away. "Come, s"

The hall was silent, as Kevan fumbled with the sheet in his hands. He gazed around, his palms were sweaty, even more that usual because standing in front of a large crowd with a written note in hand was igniting his trauma. He looked towards his teammates and then his opponents, both of them had faces as pale as the clouds in the sky. They were also reliving the same shared trauma all over again. His eyes then met the Sect Leader's, and a series of juxtaposition emotions travelled down his spine. First, there was a fearful chill that rattled him, drawn from the experience of being reprimanded and punished. But then, the Leader's encouraging smile quenched that and showered him with confidence.

Kevan shook away his apprehension and approached the podium. He cleared his throat loudly and orated the text in a measured pace. "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed adjudicators, and fellow debaters, we proudly stand before you to advocate for Definition 1 as the most fitting characterization of the Mana Unit. This definition, which ties mana to the energy required for controlled temperature alteration using the |Firestarter| spell, establishes a precise and reproducible framework. The definition of a standardised unit of measurement is clarity, consistency and reproducibility, which is what makes it scientifically sound. Our method is all the above. This approach embodies scientific rigour while highlighting the tangible outcomes of magical endeavours, leading to a comprehensive understanding of a unit of mana."

After finishing, Kevan hurriedly folded the sheet and stepped aside from the podium. By this time the Sect Leader assumed the position on the podium.

"With the first constructive statement from the team supporting Definition 1, we now have a three-minute cross-examination period. Krane-" he said while gesturing at the boy to take over. Krane sprang up from his seat behind his team's bench and locked gazes with Kevan at the podium.

"By severely limiting the conditions necessary to define the Mana Unit, are you not hindering the ability for someone else to replicate the experiment?"

Kevan let out an inaudible snarl and snapped back, "It is by ensuring that the conditions of the experiment are highly controlled, that we are able to establish a repeatable and consistent definition of the Mana Unit. By making it so severely strict, we are limiting the possibilities of deviance and errors that cause the interpretation to dally from what it was intended to be."

"That's just a cop out!" Krane retorted in disbelief. "No matter where you start from, you should be able to end up in the same location as long as the principles are the same. What you've basically done is state that the only way to get to the end goal is by walking down this extremely specific path I've laid out for you. That isn't scientific."

"Are you kidding-" Kevan started, but he was interrupted by the Sect Leader who jumped between the two and said, "And that brings an end to the cross-examination time. We will now on to team one's negative."

Kevan returned to his seat as Luce took his place on the podium. She gave the other team a sharp glare before opening up her sheet and reading her bit, "Respected adjudicators and fellow participants, we challenge Definition 1's exclusivity and rigidity. Magic is in and of itself an intricate tapestry. We believe it is counterintuitive to define such a dynamic and fluid concept in a rigid manner as it can alienate many of its applications. We believe that buy and large, the conservation of mass and energy are a sufficiently strict yet accessible rule to define a single unit of mana. It is trivial to establish STP, and so is the ability to cast a |Water Spout| spell. We believe our Definition 2 is clear and concise, and is superior as it is accessible by just about any mage without having to rely on complicated mechanisms, equipment and set-ups."

Sect Leader Larks returned to the podium and gestured for Kevan to take over for the cross-examination.

"Is your argument not flawed, since you also rely on the |Water Spout| spell as a base to determine the conversion between mana and mass?" Kevan fired immediately.

"The behaviour of water as a substance is heavily documented and predictable," Luce argued back. "If someone chooses to walk down a different path to create an interface between mana and mass to derive the Mana Unit, it is on them."

"That is extremely callous! You cannot just leave an exploration in such an open-ended manner that allows for multiple interpretations. That is unscientific!"

"You have the gall-" Luce snapped back while taking a forceful step forward, but was immediately halted by the Sect Leader's interception, "That brings the first two Constructive segments to a close. Seeing as how heated things are getting, let us take a short break to cool down. It will also give our illustrious judges some time to deliberate."

After a quick five-minute break, the debate was resumed. This time, Casey stepped forward and took the podium.

"Building upon our initial stance, Definition 1 is all about finding a common denominator among diverse magical abilities. We know that mana behaves differently based on its application. Therefore, mana is best defined as per its use cases - the actions that go into using it. This may include the spells, the conditions within which the spells are cast, and also the state of the caster. These are just a few factors that influence how mana behaves in a given situation. By ensuring that the pipeline through which the mana is being applied remains consistent, we are ensuring that the understanding of mana and a single Mana Unit remains consistent regardless of who the caster is or the conditions under which the spell is being cast. We believe that it is this surety that makes Definition 1 superior."

Sect Leader Larks walked on stage and gestured towards Luce for the cross-examination.

"While your claim is relevant, you are not tethering it to a universal law. Your method still relies on the presence of the Caloric Tank filled with the very specific Enthermis Fluid. What is your remedy if there are issues in the production of either of those two ingredients?"

"It then falls on a universal governing body to maintain the integrity of the definition," Casey said after a second of thinking. "With that in place, there won't be the issue of two people having two different kinds of apparatus or ingredients. This also ensures that the universal nature of the Definition is preserved."

Luce shook her head and said, "You will"

Affirmative Team:

2NC (Second Negative Constructive):
Expanding on the negative's stance, magic's essence lies not only in its universal principles but also in its adaptability and creative expression. Definition 1's scientific precision might inadvertently undermine the artistic nature of magic. Magic flourishes through its ability to adapt to various contexts and challenges, and Definition 1's narrow focus could inadvertently limit our comprehension of mana's essence.

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In response to the negative, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about reductionism but about establishing a common language for the measurement of mana. By measuring energy through a specific transformation, we provide a consistent yardstick for comparisons. Magic's diversity isn't negated; it's embraced through a standardized approach that transcends individual practices.

2AR (Second Affirmative Rebuttal):
While we acknowledge the negative's appreciation for magic's artistic expression, we emphasize the importance of precision and coherence. Definition 1 doesn't discount creativity; it enhances our understanding by providing a quantifiable measure. The balance between standardization and diversity is achieved through Definition 1's framework, which is both comprehensive and adaptable.

Negative Team:

1NR (First Negative Rebuttal):
In response to the affirmative, we acknowledge the aspiration for standardization, but Definition 1's tunnel vision disregards the dynamic nature of magic. Magic isn't just about science; it's an art, a creation, and an expression. By advocating for Definition 1, the affirmative risks overshadowing the essence of magic itself, which thrives through creativity and adaptability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
While we appreciate the affirmative's intent, it's vital to remember that a comprehensive understanding of mana shouldn't come at the cost of limiting magic's potential. By embracing Definition 2, which characterizes mana through the energy required for water creation via the |Water Spout| spell under standard temperature and pressure conditions, we honor both the artistry and adaptability of magic, ensuring our definition resonates with the diverse range of practitioners.

Summary Speeches:

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In our final plea, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about suppression but about providing a standardized measure that accommodates magic's universal principles. Our approach bridges the gap between precision and creativity, fostering a common ground for discussions. By quantifying mana through a specific transformation, we capture its essence while maintaining coherence and comparability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
In our closing, we reiterate that magic's essence lies in its multifaceted nature. Definition 2, which ties mana to water creation through the |Water Spout| spell, embraces magic's adaptability and creativity. By aligning mana with the act of creation, we honor the heart of magic and ensure our definition encompasses the full spectrum of magical abilities.

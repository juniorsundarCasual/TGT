The hall was silent, as Kevan fumbled with the sheet in his hands. He gazed around, his palms were sweaty, even more that usual because standing in front of a large crowd with a written note in hand was igniting his trauma. He looked towards his teammates and then his opponents, both of them had faces as pale as the clouds in the sky. They were also reliving the same shared trauma all over again. His eyes then met the Sect Leader's, and a series of juxtaposition emotions travelled down his spine. First, there was a fearful chill that rattled him, drawn from the experience of being reprimanded and punished. But then, the Leader's encouraging smile quenched that and showered him with confidence.

Kevan shook away his apprehension and approached the podium. He cleared his throat loudly and orated the text in a measured pace. "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed adjudicators, and fellow debaters, we proudly stand before you to advocate for Definition 1 as the most fitting characterization of the Mana Unit. This definition, which ties mana to the energy required for controlled temperature alteration using the |Firestarter| spell, establishes a precise and reproducible framework. By grounding magical energy in a specific context, we ensure comparability across various magical practices. This approach embodies scientific rigour while highlighting the tangible outcomes of magical endeavors, leading to a comprehensive understanding of mana's essence."

After finishing, Kevan hurriedly folded the sheet and stepped aside from the podium. By this time the Sect Leader assumed the position on the podium.

"With the first constructive statement from the team supporting Definition 1, we now have a three-minute cross-examination period. Krane-" he said while gesturing at the boy to take over. Krane sprang up from his seat behind his team's bench and locked gazes with Kevan at the podium.

"By severely limiting the conditions necessary to define the Mana Unit, are you not hindering the ability for someone else to replicate the experiment?"

Kevan let out an inaudible snarl and snapped back, "It is by ensuring that the conditions of the experiment are highly controlled, that we are able to establish a repeatable and consistent definition of the Mana Unit. By making it so severely strict, we are limiting the possibilities of deviance and errors that cause the interpretation to dally from what it was intended to be."

"That's just a cop out!" Krane retorted in disbelief. "No matter where you start from, you should be able to end up in the same location as long as the principles are the same. What you've basically done is state that the only way to get to the end goal is by walking down this extremely specific path I've laid out for you. That isn't scientific."

"Are you kidding-" Kevan started, but he was interrupted by the Sect Leader who jumped between the two and said, "And that brings an end to the cross-examination time. We will now on to team one's negative."

Kevan returned to his seat as Luce took his place on the podium. She gave the other team a sharp glare before opening up her sheet and reading her bit, "Respected adjudicators and fellow participants, we challenge Definition 1's exclusivity and rigidity. Magic is in and of itself an intricate tapestry. We believe it is counterintuitive to define such a dynamic and fluid concept with such a rigid definition that can alienate many of its applications. By isolating mana within the confines of a single spell, and a severly limiting experimentation condition, Definition 1 risks neglecting the multifaceted nature of magic. Our understanding of mana should take into consideration the variable nature of magic, and be approachable by just about anyone, since that is the beauty of magic after all."

Sect Leader Larks returned to the podium and gestured for Kevan

Affirmative Team:

1AC (First Affirmative Constructive):


2AC (Second Affirmative Constructive):
Building upon our initial stance, Definition 1 is not about simplification but about finding a common denominator among diverse magical abilities. While each practitioner wields distinct skills, the principles underpinning magic remain consistent. By quantifying mana through a specific action, we capture these universal principles. Definition 1 provides a standardized measure that respects the complexity of magic while offering a coherent basis for discussions and comparisons.

1NC (First Negative Constructive):


2NC (Second Negative Constructive):
Expanding on the negative's stance, magic's essence lies not only in its universal principles but also in its adaptability and creative expression. Definition 1's scientific precision might inadvertently undermine the artistic nature of magic. Magic flourishes through its ability to adapt to various contexts and challenges, and Definition 1's narrow focus could inadvertently limit our comprehension of mana's essence.

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In response to the negative, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about reductionism but about establishing a common language for the measurement of mana. By measuring energy through a specific transformation, we provide a consistent yardstick for comparisons. Magic's diversity isn't negated; it's embraced through a standardized approach that transcends individual practices.

2AR (Second Affirmative Rebuttal):
While we acknowledge the negative's appreciation for magic's artistic expression, we emphasize the importance of precision and coherence. Definition 1 doesn't discount creativity; it enhances our understanding by providing a quantifiable measure. The balance between standardization and diversity is achieved through Definition 1's framework, which is both comprehensive and adaptable.

Negative Team:

1NC (First Negative Constructive):
Esteemed adjudicators, fellow debaters, the negative team ardently opposes Definition 1. While the desire for precision is admirable, reducing mana to the energy required for temperature alteration under the |Firestarter| spell limits our understanding of magical diversity. Magic encompasses a vast array of abilities beyond this narrow focus. We must define mana in a manner that honors the depth of magical practices and accommodates the diverse talents of practitioners.

2NC (Second Negative Constructive):
Expanding on the negative's stance, it is essential to recognize that magical energy isn't solely measured through controlled scenarios. Magic thrives in real-world complexities, and Definition 1's confinement to a specific spell's outcome might not accurately represent the varied and intricate nature of magical abilities. To maintain the integrity of magic, our definition of mana should encompass its multifaceted aspects.

1NR (First Negative Rebuttal):
In response to the affirmative, we acknowledge the aspiration for standardization, but Definition 1's tunnel vision disregards the dynamic nature of magic. Magic isn't just about science; it's an art, a creation, and an expression. By advocating for Definition 1, the affirmative risks overshadowing the essence of magic itself, which thrives through creativity and adaptability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
While we appreciate the affirmative's intent, it's vital to remember that a comprehensive understanding of mana shouldn't come at the cost of limiting magic's potential. By embracing Definition 2, which characterizes mana through the energy required for water creation via the |Water Spout| spell under standard temperature and pressure conditions, we honor both the artistry and adaptability of magic, ensuring our definition resonates with the diverse range of practitioners.

Summary Speeches:

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In our final plea, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about suppression but about providing a standardized measure that accommodates magic's universal principles. Our approach bridges the gap between precision and creativity, fostering a common ground for discussions. By quantifying mana through a specific transformation, we capture its essence while maintaining coherence and comparability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
In our closing, we reiterate that magic's essence lies in its multifaceted nature. Definition 2, which ties mana to water creation through the |Water Spout| spell, embraces magic's adaptability and creativity. By aligning mana with the act of creation, we honor the heart of magic and ensure our definition encompasses the full spectrum of magical abilities.

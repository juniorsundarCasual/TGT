"As you already know, I've had to make a few assumptions in defining my model. The limitation of the recording device played a huge role in this, since its range was limited to the Solar System," Marie started.

"How come? The projection showed the positions of the stars and other celestial bodies beyond the Solar System," Krish pointed out.

"They did, however determining their states with just the visual would not render accurate enough information to support the modelling procedure. In fact, I am starting to suspect that even the actual three-dimensional captures of the planets in the projection were erroneous due to time differences," Marie theorised.

"What time differences?"

"Well, you should have a better understanding of how the Celestial Recording Platform captures the three-dimensional state at a point in time. My hypothesis is that it emits mana and captures the reflected mana to store the position and colour at discretised points. Am I correct in that assumption?" Marie inquired.

Krish nodded apprehensively and said, "Sort of..."

"If that is the case, then is the emitted and reflected mana faster than the speed of light? Is it instantaneous or does it take time for the mana to reach its target and then return to its source?" Marie rattled off.

"That... appears to be so."

"I suspected that would be the case," Marie murmured. "I added a correction to the positions of the celestial bodies by assuming that the mana behaves like light and travels at its speed in vacuum. An interesting find, I might add - it definitely warrants further research (something Markus would appreciate). You see, the position of the planets in the projection is shifted from their actual location since the recording captures their state at a later point in time," Marie explained.

"Nonetheless, because I've had to limit data collection to the Solar System, we are omitting the influence of the bodies beyond the limits of the System. The direct effect of this imposed limitation is the time duration for which my model can maintain its accuracy."

"Which is?" Krish probed.

"A hundred years, give or take a hundred. It depends, really. But a decent upper limit, with the best case scenario, would be three hundred years," Marie affirmed.

"Not bad!"

Marie raised a finger and accentuated, "Of course, this is subject to improvements as we add more and more to the model I've built. The closer we get to modelling the entire world, the wider the time frame becomes."

"Regardless, it is a good starting point. Even I very rarely look past a hundred years - only on rare occasions," Krish commended. "So how do we intend to bring The Heavenly Eye into this?"

"It is a matter of synchronisation. I need to tether the temporal anchor corresponding to the target I wish to divine the future of with The Heavenly Eye, to the model of the world initialised at the same anchor point. Then, I should be able to extrapolate the Constants using the model as my guide."

"And how will you accomplish all of this?" Krish inquired with a mix of concern and confusion.

"Trial and error," Marie shrugged nonchalantly.

"You are messing with fire, Marie. You KNOW just how dangerous interfering with Constants can be," Krish reprimanded sternly.

"I am not going to investigate or gaze into them, if that's what you're worried about. No. I'm, more interested in the... metadata of the Constant event," Marie rephrased. "You know? The time, place, event, nature, so on and so forth. In fact, I think you could do it for me if you're worried I'll get into trouble."

"I trust you, I'm just concerned for your health. Things can go wrong at the drop of a hat if you aren't mindful."

Marie revealed a rare smile and scratched the back of her head sheepishly. "So, when should we begin."

"No time like the present, I guess." Krish closed his eyes and gestured for his Disciple to begin.

Marie took five long breaths, emptying and refilling her lungs to their entirety multiple times.

"I am going to divine the future of the True World Sect. I find that this method works best if we can find an anchor point that falls within the time period spanned by the datasets obtained. For instance with people, it would be preferable to use their date of birth as an anchor point - I could go even further and use their time of birth and it would improve the accuracy and breadth of the prediction (this is one way to push the model's accuracy for three hundred years). I will use the date that the True World Sect was conceived as the anchor point."

Krish raised a finger and pointed out, "Why would you use the conception date as opposed to the date the Sect was legally registered as the anchor point?"

"First off, I don't even know if Sect Leader Larks has registered the Sect yet. AND, registration is just a formality. The Sect was born way before that, when the idea first spawned in Sect Leader Larks' brain," she retorted.

With that, she retrieved the gold-rimmed book with endless sheets and flipped through the pages, repeatedly mumbling the date when Mister Larks thought up the idea of starting a sect.

"Found it! Alright let's see here. Gaea's position was..." More words started to cascade out her mouth systematically. Her left hand held the open book while her right started to scribble at the last bit of empty space available on the combat field. As more and more numbers and diagrams filled up that region, a profound phenomenon started to transpire in her mental space.

It started with a single point that stretched out into a line, into a circle, finally a sphere. More and more points spawned around it and started to undergo the same transition

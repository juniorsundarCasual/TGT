Kano was not prepared for such a question. To him, it was as though someone was asking what a shoe was. A shoe was a shoe, how could you explain that?

"These stories, they have to be written somewhere, right?" Kano tried.

"They are," Kam answered while pointing at the wall.

"No, no," Kano hasitly responded while walking over to the closest segment of the mural and pointed at a scene. He let his fingers drift over the raises and dips while letting his eyes scroll over the beautifully etched dwarven script that grew increasingly bright with an ethereal purple glow. Slowly, his vision melted as a vivid scene started to play out before him. Two dwarves, one working diligently to earn a living by selling his wares, and the other sneering at his friend with visible jealousy in his eyes. The former worked hard and earned a wealth of coins in return. The latter did nought by look on enviously, until it reached a point where he succumbed to the poisonous emotion and stabbed his friend in the back, appropriating all the money the man had earned through honest blood, sweat and tears. But his outburst was not clean, as evidence eventually led to him being arrested and put to death by decapitation.

"How is this story shared?" Kano retried.

"How is any story shared?" Kan responded with a tone that implied that Kano was asking a stupid question with an obvious answer.

Kano looked at the man and awaited answer to his question, but none came. It seemed that Kam's retort in the form of a question was the answer itself.

"Do you just give a piece of this wall when someone wants to make a new mural?" Kano probed.

Kam let out a mirthful bellow that caused the man to bounce visibly.

"Of course not, my boy," Kam said after his fit of laughter settled. "Stories are just stories. They are known. Those who know can transmit it. I know all the legends etched into these walls. If someone were to ask me to replicate it, I could. Though how well I can replicate this will depend on my skill level in handling a chisel, and how well I understand the core message of the story."

"But these are laws," Kano argued. "What if a person's understanding of the legend does not align with the intended meaning. There is no way that two people can take the same message out of the same story."

"Take a look again," Kam encouraged. "And by that, I mean REALLY take a good look at the legends and try to understand them."

Kano did as told and observed the comic-like stories across the massive mural.

The materials available to them included a stand, a set of copper and zinc plates, some fibrous disk cutouts about the same size as the plates, and a bottle filled with sulphuric acid.

"This seems easier than the experiment!" Yohn exclaimed.

"It may be simplified for our benefit," Markus reasoned. "Or maybe the experiment is more explicit for the purpose of making us understand the wider context?"

"Regardless, would this work?" Yohn voiced his anxiousness.

"Let's not cast doubt before even trying it out," Markus warned. "Why don't we begin?"

The instructions were clear, and surprisingly simple. All they had to do was to stack the zinc and copper plates alternatively, with the fibrous disk cutouts soaked in sulphuric acid separating the plates - kind of like a multilayered sandwich. The instructions stated that the more stacks you place, the higher the output voltage. And since each copper-zinc pair generates roughly 0.7 to 1.1 volts, they would need to stack around 9 pairs give or take. The duo finished the task within minutes, and the result was a tower of zinc and copper, with a wire coming out the bottom and another from the top of the stack.

"So this SHOULD generate electricity," Yohn said while gazing at the creation.

"Technically," Markus affirmed doubtfully. At that instant, something triggered in his mind. Every once in a while, people have intrusive thoughts. Nine out of ten times, people don't act on it because the consequence of doing so tends to be more trouble that its worth. There was in intrusive thought currently occupying real estate in Markus' mind. And unfortunately, this also happened to be the dreaded one out of ten.

Markus held each of the cables from the cell's terminal on one hand and brought it up to his extended tongue.

"W-What are you doing?" Yohn exclaimed as his mana senses caught the movement.

"Ow!" Markus yelped. "That was stronger than I anticipated," he commented while rubbing his tongue against his lips.

"What are you doing?" A confused voice asked from behind them, causing the duo to jolt and turn around together.

"I leave you kids alone for a few minutes, and this is what I return to?" The Sect Leader said with a disappointed sigh.

"M-Master! I was just checking to see if it was working-"

"There are many safer ways to do that," the Sect Leader responded while tilting his head back in defeat.

There was silence as the Sect Leader let out a long, defeated breath. "Whatever, it's not like that the cell is going to cause great damage to a Foundation Establishment realm mage. But I can't believe I have to say this: please don't shove live wires into your mouths. It isn't just a matter of safety."

"Y-Yes, Master!"

"Yes, Sect Leader!"

"Any ways, there's no need to test it any further. It will work," Sect Leader Larks declared. "I've brought the equipment for the radio wave generation experiment as well," he said while gesturing at the wheelbarrow behind him with the aforementioned materials.

"We have enough time to finish things up today itself," the Sect Leader surmised. "Let's go!"

Markus quickly moved towards the wheelbarrow and carried the items back to the table. Yohn picked up the thin copper wire spool and started to wrap it around the iron rod to form the electromagnet while Markus connected the other components of the circuit.

Unfortunately, apart from the theatre, the Entertainment District offered very little in terms of "PG-rated" entertainment. There were gambling houses. Sure the district was colourful and bright; as the sun started to set, different lanterns were lit and hostesses wearing vibrant and alluring outfits started to stream out and pull customers towards their establishments. In fact, there were an abundance of such establishments in the district - it felt like Las Vegas or Monaco given the captivating lighting and abundance of gambling and betting games in place. Yet Guy couldn't take Dora in there, so they moved on.

There were also a myriad of bars, tea-houses, clubs and restaurants distributed amidst these gambling places. Most of these businesses ran on a booking and reservation based system. Either a room or table must be permanently booked by someone or a group, solely catering to them, or a reservation well in advance must be made for a seat. Although Guy had neither going for him, Jean did. Jean directed them to one of the better restaurants in the area called the Red Lobster, Guy could not control his expression from bursting agape at the uncanny similarity between the restaurant's name and logo with that of the franchise from his past life. His first instinct was to suspect another transmigrator of which only one name popped into his mind: Jo Way. Guy had been wondering why he had yet to hear of some mundane invention or system from his past life suddenly arriving in this world, blowing up and changing everything. After all, this was usually a regular transmigrator's bread and butter - his own attempts to output Earthly inventions like the Printing Press, Lathe and Milling machine would act as examples in this instance. However, his theories and wild fantasies were popped when he learned that the similarity was all a coincidence or as Mast would put it, the perfect synchronisation of incalculable probabilities resulting in a repeat event.

The hostess at the front, managing the reservations, guided the group to the Rasmus Clan's pre-booked room. The restaurant had two levels. At the ground level, the tables were arranged circularly, radiating outwards from the centre where a moderately large stage stood. Upon the stage, a trio of girls in their early twenties, garbed in highly fashionable and attractive clothes, each played the same instrument but ran different harmonies to support the primary motif. It was a string instrument that looked a lot like a larger cello, but was played by plucking the strings. The instrument had a hollow and pot-like base section and an almost two-feet long neck. In total, it had eight strings, with four running above the neck and four running by its side (to be playable with the thumb). The instrument was called the 'hummer' especially because of the droning sound emanated by the four strings that were accessibly by the thumb.

Their booth had every possible perks a high-end restaurant could offer to its registered clients. There were silencing enchantments.

As they approached the end of the district, Guy found something he least expected in such a posh region: a circus tent. It was unexpected because he didn't think that the rich folk in these areas Live demonstrations of flashy magic such as fire-breathing and converting the torrent of flames into different forms matching that of live animals.

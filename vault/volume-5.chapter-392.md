"Why?" Jean pressed with a snappy tone. She halted of Rianna and Shay-Hade's proseletysing and cut right to the chase. "Why do you want to recruit Kili?"

"I believe we were quite clear on the 'why'," Rianna mumbled.

"All I heard was that you recognised her special physique or bloodline, when you don't even know what it is, and wish to exploit it to train her in a cultivation method followed by your Sect Leader?" Jean pointed out. "What's in it for you?"

She skipped past Rianna's stunned expression and said, "Nothing in this world comes for free - it is a fact of life, and a key tenet of cultivation. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. So tell me truthfully, what is in it for you?"

"I..." Rianna blurted out, but her words halted as she failed to formulate a reason. "-don't know."

"It's plain curiousity," Sect Leader Larks chimed in. "I can see it in your eyes. They gleam just like my Sect Members' who are nearing an epiphany or a crucial breakthrough in their research. What I am interested to know is why. What makes Kili the optimal candidate for the cultivation method you are proposing?"

Rianna exchange a glance with Shay-Hade before explaining cautiously, "As I've explained before, the cultivation method was envisioned and followed by our Sect Leader who is- was a Tesseract Transformation realm mage. This is enough to prove that the method works."

"I disagree," Jean interjected. "Just because a cultivation method works for one person doesn't mean it will be effective for another. We both know that, so please do not insult my intelligence."

Shay-Hade let out a mirthful snort at Jean's retort, but was immediately silenced by a deathly glare from Rianna.

"I cannot share the details-"

"Then I refuse your request," Jean said plainly.

Rianna grit her teeth and expounded, "I'll explain in simple terms so that you can understand. The human body is an adaptive machine. By exposing it to scenarios and adversarial conditions repeatedly over a long period of time, one can train the body to adapt and withstand those conditions. We use this ability when training the body physically. For instance, by progressively lifting heavier weights, we can increase our strength and muscle size."

"Muscular hypertrophy," Jean affirmed. "I know what you're talking about."

"Huh? Hyper-what?" Rianna blurted out.

Jean waved her hand dismissively and said, "Continue."

"As I was saying, the body can be trained to adapt to increasingly adversarial conditions. But after a period of time, one will hit a natural wall. This is the peak a human's physique can develop to. However, our Sect Leader realised that this wall is just a construct of the mind. It is possible to push beyond this limit, but to do so, one must have the will and tenacity to endure," Rianna added.

"So, how does this apply to Kili?" Jean probed.

"Well," Rianna said with an elongated tone. "The training will follow the methodology of progressive overload. We will focus on calisthenics and bodyweight exercises mostly, with added natural weights. We will supplment this with combat training. We expect the process to last for a year or two, depending on how well Kili's body takes to the training. Then..."

"Then?"

Shay-Hade cut in at this instance and said, "Please understand that the path to greatness is never easy."

"Kili will be broken and rebuilt, again and again," Rianna said bluntly. "She will have to willingly push herself onwards, fight through the pain and push her muscles, bones and tendons to their utmost limits. When they can push no more, she will have to call upon the raw power of will to force them onwards."

"You're kidding!" Jean snapped. "This is madness!"

"Madness that is guaranteed to work. The cultivation method is so simple and straightforward that there is no chance of failure - the Sect Leader confirms it as so. It is built upon the concept of sheer, unadulterated willpower."

"You're asking me to be complicit to child abuse!" Jean yelled.

"It won't be child abuse because Kili feels no pain and regenerates from injuries that take weeks to heal within seconds," Rianna corrected. "I may not be a learned mage, but I have read enough to know that abilities like those can be counted in one hand. Upon second thought, I'm certain that what she has is a special physique, since a bloodline activation would leave physical remnants... The Universal Panacea Physique!"

Seeing Jean's subtle flinch, Rianna let out a smirk and said, "Information like that would fetch a hefty price in the black market."

"You wouldn't!"

"You're right," Rianna shrugged. "Or maybe I would. Who knows? Consider this another incentive to place Kili under my tutelage. Look, the cultivation method I'm talking about is practically legendary. Your Sect Leader is right, I am curious to see it succeed. I have personally taken this cultivation method to limits no one else barring my Sect Leader has every reached. I could not go onwards because I lacked the willpower to do so. Sure, there may come another prodigy with unbending will like my Sect Leader's who will tread the path to completion. But that may take millenia - I don't have that kind of time."

"The way you've explained it," Sect Leader Larks spoke up, "Feeling the pain and pushing through it is the key piece of the puzzle. But as you've seen, Kili does not feel pain if she doesn't want to. Furthermore, the way she heals injuries may not always follow standard processes."

"Now that I've confirmed her special physique, I am even more certain that she is the prefect candidate. Kili can be convinced to believe that she is always feeling pain just a smidgen above her limit. She can also be convinced to heal the injuries in the way defined by the cultivation method. She can also be convinced to change her body's absorbative properties to extract maximum benefits from potions, medicinal baths, and nutritional foods," Rianna contested. "So, what do you say?"

"I say no," Jean rejected firmly.

"I say... it depends," the Sect Leader mumbled.

"Sect Leader Larks! There's no way this is good for Kili!" Jean argued.

"Hear me out," Sect Leader Larks prefaced, "I'm not for the blatant abuse you intend to put Kili through. It is clearly inhumane, and it isn't something that a kid needs to be put through. Your Sect Leader may have been in a position where such measures were necessary. But I'm trying to build an environment here where kids are afforded a choice, and can practise their interests safely. So, I don't want to put Kili through the same regimen as your intention."

The man intercepted Rianna just as she opened her mouth to plead her case again and said, "I am more interested in tickling the curious itch bubbling in your eyes, though."

"Do you know why the body adapts the way it does?" The man asked. "Do you know the most optimal way to get the body to adapt? I'm sure there are superior ways that to just brute-force everything, right?"

As Rianna pondered on those questions, the man raised a finger and declared, "I hear your offer to train Kili, but raise you this in return: I am willing to give you a platform to research the cultivation method you hold so dear. Break it down into pieces and really get to know it. Maybe you will realise where you failed?"

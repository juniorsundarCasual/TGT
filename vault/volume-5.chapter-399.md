Shuri learned that she could never forget when she turned five. She could recite the entire annals of Sol Clan's History by heart without missing a single word or date. She never advertised this fact, though, her mother didn't let her. When she turned ten, she started to remember things before she was five. The spotty details started to grow clearer and make more sense. It was scary, because with these memories, she was forced to relive the emotions as they were experienced at that time. A child's emotions are stronger than an adults, because there aren't psychological coping mechanisms to limit excess.

When she turned eleven, she remembered her very first memory.

She could feel herself being squeezed through a very tight hole. Her head was undergoing a type of compression and decompression. She couldn't see anything, and she couldn't breathe either. But her sense of hearing was working on overdrive.

But following a swift ejection, where the pressure suddenly changed all around her, Shuri could feel her senses activating one after the other. The first thing was her sense of hearing.

"Congratulations, Your Highness, it's a healthy Prince!"

"Y-Yor!"

Then came her sense of smell and taste. A raw and acrid metallic odour assaulted her nascent sense of smell, and a viscous liquid nearly choked her. Then came her touch, as she felt herself getting moved rapidly, before a cold object wrapped around her neck and a heavy ball landed on her chest. She then felt her body changing, it was painful, but she could only scream inaudibly.

Finally, her sight opened up, and all she saw was red. Blood, blood everywhere. A gentle hand dabbed her face and cleared the blood away.

"We cannot let anyone know that it was a boy, Yor!" A woman's voice, her mother, expressed in a panic.

"They won't know. I have taken the precautions as you said. The pendant around his neck carries a powerful enchantment that will mask the child's gender. As long as he remains below the Core Formation realm, they will appear outwardly as a female," a man answered. "But I don't understand, isn't it a good thing? Mistress will have support since she has birthed a Prince."

"No!" the woman snapped back with faint acidity in her voice. "To be born a boy here is treacherous. Those vultures outside will descend upon us and rip us to shreds, I have no backing, no power. He will be dead before you know it. No! He has to survive. Let the scavengers fight against each other for scraps. Let them tear each other limb from limb. Let all of this go to hell until nothing but a ruin remains. That is my dream, Yor! And this child will help me achieve it."

There was a faintly rabid fanaticism in her voice, which only grew as the days passed as per Shuri's recollections.

"That is a heavy burden to place on a child," Yor reasoned.

"It is his duty!" Her mother argued back. "I raised the spawn of that lecherous degenerate for nine months. I hated every second of it. I wished to kill myself everyday I saw my reglection. It was disgusting! But I endured. Killing myself was the easy way out- No, revenge is what I want. The man too everything from me, it is only right that his son does the same to him."

Each woman who entered the Inner Courtyard was tattooed with a ritual that forbade any sort of invasive inspection of the womb. It was the decree of the second Emperor, as his reign saw the most number of miscarriages in the entire Empire's history. Even the birthing chambers were shielded away with magic, to avoid infanticide.

"Now! Call in the crowd. Let's satisfy their curiosity," her mother declared before laying down on the birthing mattress. She started to breathe heavily until her face warped with fake yet convincingly real horror. Just as Yor opened the doors to the chamber, she shrieked loudly.

"What happened?!" Her father rushed in, with his red heair streaking behind him majestically. "What is all this?"

"T-The midwife-" her mother started with a fearful stutter.

"The woman wished to harm the Princess," Yor, or Eunuch Bang, answered. "This servant was vigilant and took action as soon as he detected the threat."

"Did you say Princess?" Her father repeated with disappointment.

"Yes, Your Majesty!"

"Disappointing," the Emperor evoked before turning and leaving just as quickly as he came.

And thus, Shuri entered the world with a purpose. He was supposed to be the instrument of his mother's revenge against his father. To achieve said purpose, he had to live as a she to avoid becoming a valuable target.

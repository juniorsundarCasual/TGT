Once the caravan passed through the gates, the group arrived at a sprawling docking and warehousing district dedicated to loading and unloading caravans. Amidst the din of neighing and whinnying horses being directed to their stables, porters screaming to attract the attention of incoming caravans, merchants and caravan leaders yelling to direct their subordinates, and the general commotion of crates and boxes being dropped or dragged, Guy followed the escort group to a warehouse under Dune Caravan Management's sigil. The place was like a walled off compound in a long line of similarly designed buildings, with two gates to facilitate entry and exit by carriage, and a smaller entrance for foot traffic. Each of these entrances was guarded by a squadron of individuals sporting the company's attire, which Guy found out were actually mages in a realm above his own!

Guy used to wonder why even large companies with the capacity to train a retinue of guards with such high power levels would bother hiring out escorts. After some analysis, the answer became clear. To train and raise individuals with such strength required a large investment of resources. A company's primary goal is to generate profits, raising a retinue is a side investment towards achieving this goal and is therefore something the generated profits are siphoned into. It would be a waste to lose this investment due to an ambush from rogue elements such as mages, magical beasts, or even natural disasters while out on the road. So, companies tend to hold their stronger cards closer to their chests and use their retinue solely for defence, opting for sects - who happen to be specialised in escorting and general mercenary work - for every other situation where loss of assets is a certainty.

The escort group was guided into the compound's office building, to the manager's room, where they were handed their payments for services rendered. The amount was decided prior to departure, but a bonus was tacked for various factors such as time of arrival, loss of assets during transit, and so on. All in all, the True World Sect earned just short of two thousand gold coins, while the Whispering Dusk Sect's group earned two-and-a-half thousand. True World Sect's original slice was much smaller, but considering Guy's contribution towards a smooth and hassle-free journey, a large portion of the bonus was relegated to his Sect over Whispering Dusk. There was no opposition on this decision from Korren's side since he felt it was fair. Furthermore the True World Sect's name was properly advertised - Guy was certain that Dune Caravan Management would consider his Sect for their next venture without him having to approach them with another request.

Guy carried the sleepy Dora out of the compound with Jean and Markus; Josie had departed a little while earlier to prepare the Rasmus Clan's mansion in the Capital for their stay and to send out a voice transmission via a Communication Ritual Formation to inform Goran of Jean's safe arrival.

Most large clans in the Solar Empire owned and maintained a mansion in the Capital. In fact, most large clans maintained mansions in most major cities across the Empire as long as it fell within their financial capacities, but the Capital was a must. Decisions that could change the face of the nation as a whole would require the vote and go ahead from the clans holding titles, for this, immediate attendance from the clan leaders as representatives of their Clans. Sometimes, these meetings could go on for days on end thus warranting a place to stay within the Capital; teleporting back and forth becomes more expensive as the distance increases.

Guy also counted himself lucky that Jean happened to be a part of his Sect. Although in doing so she would be sacrificing her chance to contest for the Clan Leader position, she wouldn't be dissociated with the Rasmus Clan. This provided her with certain benefits, such as being able to host her guests in her Clan's mansions all across the Empire. Essentially, the True World Sect had just earned itself a free lodging service in all the famous cities in the Empire. This was a great boon since finding a place to stay was a monumental task in the Capital. As the largest city in the Empire, and by some estimates in the whole of Gaea, it was constantly in an overcrowded state as people flocked in from everywhere. Especially now that both the Sect Alliance and Co-operative of Teachers were holding events in the city, finding an unoccupied room at an inn would be impossible.

Dora released a loud yawn and fell into a deep slumber on Guy's shoulders. The journey had drained the little girl completely. Sleeping on a carriage was uncomfortable to begin with, doing so for days on end would be torturous for a child. Even with Guy's superior physique after his advancement, he was experiencing minor lower back aches. He couldn't even imagine of these caravaneers did it so regularly.

Nonetheless, since the primary sightseer was out of commission, Guy decided to call it an early day since it was already an hour past noon. He was certain that if they explored the Capital today without Dora in tow, the girl would throw another tantrum and force them to revisit all the places again for her sake. Jean and his Disciple agreed, so the all followed Jean as she guided them to the Rasmus Mansion.

The building was in the most affluent sections of the Capital which was within the walled layer closest to the centre. To get there from the warehousing district, they had to take a path leading up the walls containing the Capital.

Jerain Hugin was the fifth and youngest son of the current Leader of the Hugin Clan, which was a Marquis' household under the Gruul Duchy. Born to a cabaret dancer turned concubine, with nine other siblings above him, Jerain's existence was more-or-less relegated to the extreme periphery of the clan. From birth, he'd have to grovel, beg, bow and occasionally steal to get what he wanted. To live like a servant in what was supposed to be his household fuelled the flames borne of his low self-esteem and moulded him into the kind of youth he was today.

As expected, Jerain's greatest wish and current goal in life was to supercede all of his siblings and eventually take on the mantle of Clan Leader. To do so, however, he required strength and backing. Unfortunately, the two were part of loop akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy. To get better resources, one needed a strong backing, and to get a strong backing one needed actual strength backing their claim. Jerain could only curse over the unfortunate circumstances of his birth.

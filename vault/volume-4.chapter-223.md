The sun was at its zenith in its arc traversing from one end of the horizon to the other, bearing down imperiously over the vast Regal Plains - an unblemished sprawling flat grassland that reigned dead-centre of the Solar Empire. There were no irregularities in the Regal Plains, it was as if a giant sword had sliced across a large patch of land, removing everything in its path, leaving a perfectly flat surface, then another sprinkled a fresh coating of grass over this barren flatland.

Three different rivers - the Indigo-Chill, Ragged-Current and Bubbling-Blue - swept through the region depositing minerals and augmenting the soil health. The Indigo-Chill River flowed Northwest to Southwest, spawning in the Indigo-Crest Mountains in the purview of the Balen Duchy - the river cuts through the Northern regions of the plains and joins into the sea at the Eastern end of the Empire. The Ragged-Current River has multiple spawning regions, one of which is the Southern most mountain of Serrated-Peaks in the Maika Duchy. The stream originating from there is corroborated by another from the Deep-Turquoise Lake which borders both the Maika and Balen Duchy - hence inducing the ragged currents - and cuts right through the centre of the Regal Plains and meets the sea at the south of the Empire. Finally, the Bubbling-Blue is a mischievous one that originates and terminates within the Draul Duchy at the Southeast of the Empire, simply arcing through the Southeastern quadrant of the Plains during its journey.

Needless to say, with three flowing water bodies gracing the region, these were highly fertile grounds. The periphery of the plains are plastered with farmlands, worked by farmers to support the enormous structure that stood at the centre of the Plains and, by extension, the Solar Empire - Sunspot, the City of Dawn, the Capital of the Solar Empire, the abode of the Solar Emperor and his Clan. Sunspot was a massive city, one which covered over forty-percent of the sprawling Regal Plains; to get from one end of the city to the other by foot would take a day and a half at best.

The city was ancient, in mortal terms. Its origin extended back to the founding of the Empire itself around 2000 years ago. The first Emperor - the Sun's Avatar as people called him - united all the powerful Clans and minor rulerships governing the contested regions around him either though force or diplomacy (mostly force) and planted the throne at the centre of his Empire in Sunspot.

From a strategic standpoint, the choice of location was suboptimal, given how there was literally no natural protection in the region - the city could be attacked from any direction with equal ease. However, from a trade and logistics perspective, it was supreme. The many rivers flowing through the region an easy mode of transport from the different parts of the Empire directly to the Capital. The plains were also easy to patrol, ensuring that few miscreants established roots and hindered trade. 

Furthermore, since it was located smack-dab in the middle of the Empire, any invading force would have to wade through the lands of the Empire's vassals before arriving at the Capital - unless of course some subterfuge and clandestine tactics are involved. Additionally, the First Emperor did not believe that anyone would successfully overthrow him. He was invincible! Unshakeable! Unstoppable! His words.

The First Emperor's reign was short. He abdicated the throne the tenth year after the Empire stabilised to pursue advancement in his cultivation. As an immortal in the Tesseract Transformation Realm, he that found court proceedings and diplomacy were hampering him. He wasn't cut out for it, and his soul was starting to stagnate.

Since it was established, Sunspot grew every few centuries in a form of circumferential or sectoral expansion. The first city was akin to a circle with a wall around it. During the second expansion, another layer was added around the wall and a wall was build to encompass this new layer. Such expansions proceeded a few more times before it became impractical, at which point sectoral growth was pursued. A new sector would be added with a wall around it, connecting with the inner walls. Like that, a near maze-like city grew into existence. And due to the physical boundaries put in place, the poor and destitute were organically eked out into the outer periphery as the rich and flourishing congregated near the centre, closer to the Palace.

The Palace was both a magnificent architectural masterpiece and an exquisite work of art combined into one august and imposing structure that commanded respect and awe from those observing it. 

A significant portion of the Palace was made off of a special kind of enchanted glass, capable of converting solar rays and enriching the ambient mana, raising the mana density of the Palace to match, and even exceed, the levels of large sects.

In the recent years, that is since the reign of the current Solar Emperor, the Palace underwent a second expansion. Although the style and theme of this new section matched that of the old visually, the similarity did not extend into its percieved aura. Every excellent piece of work is defined as such because it transcends the superficial - it holds a special meaning that enraptures the observer in some way. The original Palace was the culmination of the works of many professionals accross different fields. With free-reign and nigh endless resources, they were given a wide berth in terms of how the Palace could be built. All they were told by the First Emperor was that "it must be timeless!"

And timeless it was. Every nook and cranny of the Palace tells a story, about its history, all the efforts that went into the formation of the Empire, the contribution of various people along the way, and so on. Every coloured pane stood out by itself, every painting and ceramic adorning the halls told a story.

Unfortunately, the architects of the new wing could not capture this timelessness. In some ways, it wasn't their fault either. The current Emperor had commissioned the new expansion out of necessity. There was just not enough space within the Palace to house his Empress, Consorts and Concubines!

Ultimately, this callous and imperceptibly depraved intention behind building the extension seeped into its walls. A faint aura of decadence prevailed in this region of the Palace. Kin fighting against kin through clandestine means, infanticide, poisoning, every possible

After her emotions returned to her, Jean immersed herself in them wholeheartedly. She was excited to be able to feel once again, and she wanted to make up for all the lost time. Whenever she had time, she would smile, laugh, frown, rage, fear, but amongst all the emotions available in the spectrum, she avoided sorrow and crying the most. Her life up to this point had been filled with it, and she wanted to balance out all the sorrow with positive and uplifting emotions.

To that end, Jean made a selfish decision. Goodbyes were often sorrowful and charged with emotion. Promises of returning safely never did put people's hearts at ease, especially since the world outside was so perilous, wraught with danger around every corner. So, before the first crow of the rooster signifying the crack of dawn, she hoisted Kili and left the Sect with her packed bags. She felt bad about doing it this way, but she really didn't want to exhaust herself by crying.

In order to avoid getting caught, Jean followed the path leading to the Sect's back entrance which was usually reserved for shipments and moving cargo. She pushed through the large, heavy doors and faced the world outside the Sect's walls. She took a deep breath. The sun hadn't risen, and the forests beyond were drenched in darkness. But it didn't feel as scary as she thought it to be.

"A little early for a walk," a voice called out to her from outside. Jean's head yanked in that direction and noticed a figure walking out from the shadows.

"Big Sis!" Jean exclaimed in surprise, before calming down, "I should have known."

Marie shrugged while revealing a sly smile. "Sneaking out in the middle of the night. One would think you are up to no good."

"I don't want to cry," Jean stated plainly.

"See that's where you're mistaken," Marie chastised before pulling Jean into a hug, squishing the still sleepy Kili between them. "You don't get to decide on this matter all by yourself. Farewells aren't just for you, they're for the people you leave behind as well."

Jean suppressed the heat making its way towards her eyes before croaking out, "You should know better than anyone else what my future entails. Why do you participate in this practise?"

Marie separated herself from Jean and said, "It is because I know what will happen - what you will do and what you will achieve in this journey - that I am here and wishing you a pleasant and fruitful journey."

"Be a bit more cryptic, why don't you?" Jean shot back with a sarcastic tone.

Marie clicked her tongue and flicked Jean on her forehead, "It seems my abrasive personality has rubbed off on you, no pun intended. Anyways, have a safe trip, try not to get into too much trouble, and make sure you return back with all you body parts intact."

She then ruffled Kili's hair and whispered something into the girl's ears. She then finished with a loud statement, "Take care of your Jean for me. If she does anything stupid, you know what to do!"

Without waiting for another second, Marie turned around, walked through the doors and closed them behind her as she returned to the Sect leaving Jean and the now partially awakened Kili by themselves.

"Umm..." Kili mumbled while rubbing her sleep-filled eyes. "Where are we?"

"We are going on a trip," Jean declared before picking up both their travel bags. "Come on, let's see how much progress we can make before sunrise."

As Jean started moving, she noticed Kili standing in place and squirming erratically.

"Kili? What's wrong?"

Kili's face turned a blushing red shade as she bit down on her lower lips in embarrassment.

"Umm..."

"What is it, Kili?"

"I-I need to go to the toilet," Kili mumbled in a low voice.

"..."

"That was a quick trip," Marie joked while approaching Jean as she stood outside the public toilets. "What did you learn? Did you gain anything out of it?"

"Oh bite me!" Jean shot back.

"What's all this racket?" Matron Reva bellowed while swallowing a yawn. "Uh Jean? Why are you standing with your bags packed?"

"She was about to sneak out in the middle of the night?" Marie blurted out while shooting a challenging wink in Jean's direction.

"You were what?!" Matron Reva exclaimed.

"I-I can explain," Jean chimed in immediately, hoping to quell the stout demoness' rage.

"Oh you had better!"

And then, Jean narrated her entire story to the Matron. As she did so, the observing crowd grew in size as the other occupants of the sect started to converge. Jean had conveniently forgotten that the public bath and toilet was a high-traffic location especially in the morning. 

Ultimately, word got out and Matron Reva left Jean no option other than to have breakfast first. After one of the most hearty and uncharacteristically heavy breakfasts of Jean's life, a horde followed her and Kili as they approached the Sect's exit (the front gates this time).

Through some rather obscene "hardcore parkour" of rationalisation, Guy's fractured mind (following the gruesome chain of terrorist attacks and mass murder) had mended. Well, mended was a generous descriptor for the fragile yet somehow unified state his mind was in. Evidently, the "glued container" that was his mind was still missing a few key pieces that no amount of rationalisation could replace. As a result of this, a sense of uneasiness kept growing withing Guy with the progression of time.

The question that plagued him and caused this uneasiness was regarding the true nature of the Other Guy inhabiting his body. "Do I have dissociative identity disorder?"

In a sense, the feeling was eerily similar - a second personality of his took the "spotlight" and unseated him for an appreciable duration. However, although the symptoms matched, he wasn't certain if labeling the phenomenon after the psychological condition was apt. For one, he learned about DID during his study of child psychology - every known case of DID had spawned at a riper age when a person's development was still undergoing changes (that is to say that it only happened in children). Continuous and harrowing psychological and physical trauma result in DID within children, but in adults it often manifests as post-traumatic stress disorder or borderline personality disorder since their identities have solidified.

Guy was certain that, while dissociative, this disorder wasn't wholly psychological but spiritual. Of course, this urged the line of inquiry contending the relationship between psychology and the soul, or even physiology and the soul. What even WAS the soul? This entered a realm of metaphysics that Guy could only make assumptions about.

"Metaphysics..."

The whole debacle with the Other Guy came into play when Guy unwittingly immersed himself into the drivel peddled in cult literature. The RoK was a conducive place to learn as it was, after all, "inside" his soul. In a sense, studying in that place had a similar effect to meditation. The knowledge perused over there was more ingrained into Guy's memories as opposed to learning in the physical world. After some thought, Guy connected it with an adage his high-school headmaster used to preach about during every school assembly.

"The mind is like an ever-growing corridor. With every new book read, and knowledge gained, a new portal is added to this corridor. The more the knowledge is used, the longer the portal remains open. When a "knowledge" becomes unused, the portal closes, and the room it leads to starts to accumulate dust and grime."

At that time, Guy wasn't mature or attentive enough to understand the implications of those words. He simply shelved them away in one of those metaphorical portals, never to be used again.

"Having a lengthy corridor is great, but it is equally important to ensure that each room in the corridor in periodically aired and maintained."

That is to say, one must regularly brush up on known knowledge to keep themselves informed and competitive in the scholarly environment.

The RoK was Guy's corridor. The book in the RoK were things Guy had already read in his past life - there was no "new" or "unknown" information in there. Everytime he opened and read a book in the RoK, he was "airing" out the closed room in the corridor and brushing himself up on what he already knew.

In his past life, Guy kept a healthy distance from any knowledge pertaining to religion, faith, or metaphysics. Till his inevitable demise in his past life, Guy was an ardent atheist. Although, he was tolerant of other religions as it was necessary in his line of work. Faith is the process through which humans derive meaning in events that exceed their level of understanding. A religion adds on to this by also codifying morals and ethics. Guy believed that relying on faith as a crutch to fill in the blanks in societal knowledge was inevitably detrimental to the advancement of society as a whole. He also believed morals and ethics fell on a spectrum - while there was a clear black and white, there was also a long span of gray of varying gradients in between that religious codes often pigeonholed into binary categories. Finally, Guy stayed away from indulging in religion because he did not want his teaching to be biased towards one line of thought; he wanted his students to be active and free thinkers capable of making their own judgements based on logic and facts.

Because of this, the RoK initially lacked any entries on religious texts of any kind - there was never a door in his corridor that catered to that information in the first place.

But then Mast did the unthinkable, he brought in books that were never there to begin with. Symbolically, this was akin to carving out a hole in the corridor and building a room without the knowledge of the owner of the corridor. When Guy read it and internalised it (that to while staying inside the RoK) his mind recognised that the information, which initially did not exist, was actually there all along!

"Evidently, this 'new room' turned into the Church," Guy concluded. It was the only possible explanation, given how Mast kept being so vague and mysterious about it.

There was no literature in the RoK that Guy could use to evaluate the effect of implanting memories and information directly into another person's brain in such a mysterious manner. Sure, there were techniques like hypnosis and suggestion that could be used to achieve similar result, but the modes were completely different. What Mast had done was equivalent to copy-pasting information into a person's memory - it was direct.

Unfortunately, the process brought a side-effect. To harken back to the corridor analogy, what Mast did was bring a room from somewhere and connect it to the corridor. However, before attaching the room to the corridor, he forgot to vacate it. Someone was inside that room when it joined up with Guy's corridor!

Now, that "someone" was fighting for control over the corridor (and winning!).

To top it off, the Other Guy was borne of knowledge pertaining to cults and their ilk. A cult is a subset of religion, that is defined subjectively by either the number of followers OR the extreme-ness of the teaching preached within (whether it runs a foul with the consensus of what is considered moral or ethically correct). Needless to say, the Other Guy's sense of right and wrong were heavily skewed and ran counter to Guy's.

However, at the end of the day, this was something Guy had to live with. He could not do anything about the Other Guy because he didn't know what to do! Magic and spirituality was already beyond his level of understanding. And he could not recruit assistance from the experts in his proximity because it would eventually expose the fact that he was a transmigrator to the world and attract the wrath of the one above who built this world. As a result, Guy resolved to solving this problem using the abilities he brought with him from his past life.

Guy extricated himself from Jean and Josie and their mission and quickly returned to the nearest town with Dora. He would have very much loved to help out the two healers - he sorely wished to remedy the inhuman treatment the villagers were being subjected to - but he also realised that he was just going to keep delaying the inevitable by shoving the problem aside.

The town was called Resting, an apt name given the overall lethargic atmosphere in the area. It also didn't help that a pandemic was literally next door; most of the people had already fled the place in fear. Those that remained were primarily large businesses or people with deep roots in the town. Thankfully, there was a functioning inn that offered shelter for cheap. He sent Dora to do her thing safely (he made sure to emphasise that countless times), and entered meditation through yoga.

"Other Guy, I have come to bargain!" Guy yelled through the tear in the RoK and waited for a response from the other side.

"This can't keep going on like this," he added. "We have to work things out."

"Why should I do that?" An imperious voice cut through the static emanating from the other end of the crack.

"We're sharing a body-"

"If I wait it out, I won't have to share it anymore," the voice emphasised.

"Do you really want to do that?" Guy probed.

"Why should I bother keep an indecisive waste of space such as yourself occupying my vessel?" The voice scoffed. "The sooner you're gone, the sooner I can get on with my grand purpose."

"Of course! Your purpose... Spreading the truth of the world and unravelling the lies that keep the uninformed masses in check? Something like that?" Guy mocked. "Let me tell you, your so called 'purpose... its not going to go the way you think."

"Ha!" the Other Guy scoffed. "And do enlighten me, why would that be?"

"You are the kind of guy who burns bridges," Guy highlighted. "For you, people fall under one of two categories: those that are with you (and align with your views) and those that are against you (or who disagree with your views). Do you think everyone will just automatically follow your every word? Sure you can force them with the voice, but is that really what you want at the end of the day? A bunch of puppets miming your every word mindlessly?"

Guy did not receive a response, this meant that the Other Guy was atleast receptive to Guy's words.

"If you want to make changes you not only need to start from the bottom, but you also need to create receptivity at the top. Otherwise, the water that boils up will never find an outlet to escape. To do that, you need to negotiate and collaborate with people. Do you think you can manage that?"

"I can be 'convincing' if I want to," the Other Guy growled.

"And that is your problem. Telling someone to do it and making them willing to do it are two different things. Which do you think is superior?"

Again, no response.

"Furthermore, I admit that you are a far better orator than I am. You are able to work a crowd more dynamically and with greater immersion. But you lack the expertise to teach. What do you intend to do with all the kids joining the Sect? Do you plan on leaving them to their own devices after throwing away some motivational lines? How would that be any different from every other sect we've seen so far?"

"I am already setting the stage for you to realise your ultimate goal. The quickest way into the hearts of people is through material goods, which is what the Verum Trading Company seeks to do," Guy highlighted. "Take a moment to consider me and my capabilities objectively. You were right when you said that we share a lot of similarities in our core, and that our competencies and personalities deviate greatly. But that isn't a bad thing. What you lack, I have in spaded and vice versa. We complete each other, don't you see?"

"ENOUGH!" The Other Guy declared forcefully, before a tense silence escaped through the tear.

The Other Guy hummed and then said with a chuckle, "It sounds like you just want me to do your dirty work? You want an excuse, and I'm the most convenient one."

"I won't lie," Guy admitted. "I am lacking in many crucial ways that pertain to our survival. You can fill in those gaps. But that does not mean you are without any shortcomings. There is no shame in accepting them."

"What do you want, then?" the Other Guy shot back exasperatedly.

"Well, my first thought was to work towards a merging-"

"I don't wish to lose myself into you," the Other Guy denied decisively.

"Don't think of it that way. Think of it as gaining something," Guy assuaged.

"Package it however you want, but the end result won't be me."

"I figured that you would say that," Guy said with a sigh. "Which is why I present you an alternative. It will be a bit more difficult."

"A system that satisfies both parties," Guy proposed. "Rules, conditions, and so on."

Suddenly, the void peering through the tear shuffled to reveal an eye.

"Go on."

"We will establish conditions for relinquishment of the 'light' so that control of the body can be switched between us. It also enforces conditions for when big decisions need to be made so that both parties are involved rather than just one," Guy continued.

"Since there are two of us, one must be the primary," the Other Guy pointed out.

"I will be the primary."

"WHAT?!"

"Hear me out-"

"Save your sophistry. I was wrong to underestimate your nature. Under that bumbling facade, you hide a venomous snake!" The Other Guy accused.

"It's not like that," Guy tried to cut in.

"I will take what is rightfully mine-"

"You want to talk about right?!" Guy cut into his counterpart's emotionally charged tirade. "I was the one thrust into this body once its previous owner relinquished it, not you. You were just a byproduct of an experiment gone wrong. What you are is a parasite, a worm piggy-backing off of the work of others. I'll say it once, and I will say it again, you will NEVER be able to achieve anything by yourself. Every step you take, while decisive, lacks the wisdom or future sight. You don't know how to take two steps back to take three steps forward. And worst of all, you are selfish-"

"Take that back!"

"Why? Too hard to digest?" Guy goaded. He was growing frustrated with the childish immaturity of the man beyond the crack. "Do you know what sacrifice or compromise even means? To give away something valuable for the benefit of another, willingly? When the chips are down, do you think you can do it?"

"Enough!"

"You preached with such gusto about how you 'avenged' the children hurt by the Beggars' Sect. But did you stop to think how your unapologetic culling of an entire organisation would affect the Capital's ecosystem as a whole?"

"They were weeds! Their existence was a malaise to society."

"Even weed has purpose in an ecosystem. This ill society has been functioning for years. By removing a monolith, you have paved the way for smaller factions to fill in the gaps. This will lead to more conflicts and deaths. A hammer is not a multipurpose tool - if you strike a screw, all you will do is damage the surface. While I agree with your assessment of the Beggars' Sect, if you had conferred your actions with me, we could have gone down a more reasonable path with fewer bloodshed and collateral damage," Guy expounded.

"You don't seem to have an off button, is what I'm trying to say," Guy summarised. "Bulldozing through everything isn't a catch-all solution. Furthermore, we have more responsibilities. The kids, for instance."

"I know how to manage my flock," the Other Guy grumbled.

"Your "flock" are still youth going through their most crucial stage of development. How much experience do you have working with people their age?" Guy challenged. "I, for one, actually have a resume loaded with verifiable work experience in this particular field."

"So, in the grand scheme of things, you taking control of my body as the primary is more detrimental to your cause, do you not agree?" Guy followed up immediately.

"Huh? What?"

"Do you not agree?!" Guy repeated.

"Do I not agree? Or do I not not agree? Double negatives... so yes?" The Other Guy had unwittingly fallen into a classic verbal trap through a targetted barrage of facts and logic ending with a convoluted mess of a question.

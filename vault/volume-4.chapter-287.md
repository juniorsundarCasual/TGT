Through some rather obscene "hardcore parkour" of rationalisation, Guy's fractured mind (following the gruesome chain of terrorist attacks and mass murder) had mended. Well, mended was a generous descriptor for the fragile yet unified state his mind was in - there was still room for recovery and growth. But this wasn't the reason for Guy's growing uneasiness.

Guy wasn't in the mood to indulge his student-turned-sect-member in her quest to solve a local pandemic, no matter how much he wished to help those struggling within the inhumane quarantine. His state of mind just wasn't in a position to empathise, and it was growing more and more preoccupied with another slowly burgeoning notion.

Ever since he departed from the Capital, and was left to his own merry devices, Guy really got to thinking about how everything played out. And what scared him the most was that the Other Guy took complete control of his body without Guy's knowledge or input. He really wanted to understand what exactly happened; it wasn't a pleasant feeling or memory to feel like a guest

<!-- "Do I have some sort of multiple personality disorder?"

The feeling was eerily similar to dissociation - a second personality of his took the "spotlight" and unseated him for an appreciable duration. The symptoms matched, but Guy was confident that it wasn't the case since multiple personality disorder is usually preceded by a serious and long term trauma during the developmental years of a person (that is during their childhood). This had to be something else, and Mast either refused to explain it to Guy properly, or didn't bother learning about it altogether. -->

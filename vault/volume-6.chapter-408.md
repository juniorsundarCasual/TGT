The last thing Kano saw before an uncomfortable darkness seized him was a crack in the sky hurtling towards him, two tears forming by his and his sister's side revealing a disgusting shade if black that started to suck them in like a ravenous beast. Kano dove to the ground by instinct, to grab hold of the solid ground. But that too turned soft like liquid under the suction of the tears, and the vine he was holding on to for dear life got dislodged with the soil and Kano was sent hurtling into the void.

The sensation of whatever was happening to him was extremely discomfiting. It was like he was falling endlessly with a constant speed, but there was no fixed direction to his freefall. It was like he was falling in all directions at once. It did not make sense. He remembered Medium Sis Jean talking about how the inner ear is the one that manages a person's equilibrium and balance. Kano didn't hear anything, maybe the problem was with his inner ear?

Was he dead?

Was he going to die?

A lot of questions hurtled through his panicking mind as he remained suspended in the void for what could either be an eternity or a very short period of time - it was hard to tell the difference as there was no frame of reference.

But within seconds, (minutes, hours, days, months, or years) he could see a brightness illuminating the void in the form of a tear. Kano didn't have to do anything as his body was being drawn in that direction automatically. The tear grew larger - or maybe he was just getting closer - and suddenly, Kano was ejected from the void into... a grim place.

The air smelt burnt and sulphuric, and there were explosions and sounds of bubbling echoing all around him. He was still in darkness, but his surroundings were solid. Kano took a second to feel around in the dark and confirmed that what surrounded him were just rocks - really warm rocks. He stood up only to bang his head against the ceiling, which was also hard rock. He yowled in pain, and was shocked to hear his own voice echoing in his ears but much louder. It was at that moment Kano realised... he was stuck. There were walls all around him, and there was just enough space for him to crouch and move his hands about.

A sense of claustrophobia started to creep up on him at a blazingly exponential rate. Within seconds Kano was hyperventilating. He could not make any noise, because his voice was caught in his throat. He looked around for the disgusting crack of darkness, but it seemed that it had closed itself after ejecting him. Ironically, that endless void felt safer than the premature burial he was going through right now.

The world was closing in.

His breathing grew more and more difficult with each passing second.

The light - or whatever remained in the darkness - grew dimmer.

...

..

.

BOOM!

Kano's world rumbled, and the consciousness that was nearly extinguished sparked to life once again.

BOOM!

The coffin of stone that Kano was buried in vibrated once again. Kano slowly moved into a crouch and started to feel around. The vibration repeated itself at non-uniform intervals, and felt stronger after each one. Whatever was happening, was getting closer.

Kano did not know what to feel as the vibrations grew louder, closer... and scarier. Was it a good thing? Would it have been better to just die of oxygen depreviation?

Just as an answer to that grim question took shape in his mind, the walls around him cracked. This wasn't the type of crack that brought him here, though. This one felt immensely more dangerous, as he realised that even the slightest error would mean getting crushed in the debris.

Another tremor and the cracks grew larger.

And then another, and this time dust started to tumble down on Kano's face. Kano felt the last tremor in his bones. Whatever was approaching was right at his metaphorical doorsteps.

Just when he anticipated the world to vibrate, something even crazier happened. The solid ground he was standing on parted like water. Kano was literally about to drown in liquid rock (not lava), but something scaley slithered up that encompassed him. He suddenly found himself wrapped in thick scales, the whole process of how he entered this scaley cage was completely missed by him as it happened so quickly. Nonetheless, he was afforded a small hole through which he could look out and observe the world, though there was nought to see except the flowing solid rock in a magically liquid state.

At that moment loud, ear-shattering, screech of a hundred eagles layered on top of each other and brought down by at least three octaves resonated all around him. Kano's "vehicle" finally burst through all the rock, revealing the outside world to him - a dangerous barren field of volcanic flows and jagged rock faces. The air was burning here, and the stench of sulphur was much stronger. Kano was totally discombobulated as his "vehicle" started to move more erratically while twisting and turning. In one instance, the scales that encompassed him separated just as the "vehicle" made a sharp turn, causing him to once again get ejected. He rolled and tumbled for a few seconds, cutting and bruising himself in the process, before he ended up behind a rocky outcropping. Kano hurriedly slithered forward and hid himself, and peeked out from behind the outcropping to get a better view of what was happening around him.

"Get over here ya' overgrown snake!" A gravelly voice boomed as a a burning chain shot past Kano, carrying a flaming hook, and attached itself to its target - a massive snake- NO!

"D-DRAGON!" Kano screamed in shock.

"Eh?!" The gravelly voice exclaimed from behind Kano. The boy turned around, and was shocked to see another individual just about his height looking back at him. What surprised him even more was that this person was definitely not a child, as they had a flowing lock of bright-red facial hair tied neatly into a rope-like knot, and an even longer lock of bright-red hair braided and folded securely. The small man had a large button nose and an angry face, which was wrinkled slightly indicating that he was probably of middle-age.

"What in the world...?" The small man said while cocking his bright-red and bushy brows up. But any follow up inquiry was halted as the same reverberating cacophony of many eagles, which Kano now realised was a dragon's roar, resounded and started to draw closer at a frightening rate.

The man quickly shoved Kano aside and pulled out a simple looking shield that was nearly his height - from where this thing came out Kano did not know. The rock outcropping shattered and rows of dangerous dagger-like teeth surged forward. The man was swallowed... almost. He had secured precarious footing inside the beast's maws, with the shield stopping the jaws from collapsing.

"Why don't we handle this situation like civilised folk, huh?" The man said while the beast raised its head and start

Marie was assigned a liaison from the Hidden Celestial Sect, who guided her from the innermost guest entertainment room towards their destination - the Sect's Historic Archives and Celestial Records, the entrance to which was literally at the foot of the central peak. Unfortunately, there was no direct path from the top of the mountain to its base; its slope was far too steep and slippery due to the sea spray and moss. As a result, their trajectory was a winding one that took her all the way around the Sect, from one peak to the other through the stone or rope bridges connecting the island-mountains together at different levels.

Not that Marie was complaining about the long detour. Knowing that her bounty was just a few kilometres away and wasn't going anywhere assuaged some of her antsiness. This in turn allowed her to appreciate the sights the sect had to offer. The overall theme prevailing in the sect's design was "age and majesty". Marie could feel the history radiating from every nook and cranny of the sect's exterior and interior. And it made sense, because if this sect was created was established during her Great-Grandmaster's time, then it was at least five-thousand years old which would predate the Solar Empire!

An ear-shattering harmony of bellows cracked through the air, followed by the sound of feet stomping the ground and muscles tightening. Marie looked over the low wall and saw a formation of youths moving through a choreographed sequence of punching and kicking. Her brows furrowed as she observed their actions in greater detail. It bugged her just how telegraphed and loud it all was - it didn't seem practical for combat applications.

As though she were reading Marie's thoughts, the liaison, who was somewhere in her mid-twenties, expounded, "The initiates are practising their Forms for unarmed combat as per the Hidden Celestial Sect's Exclusive Martial Arts Suite."

"Does fighting like this even work?" Marie probed with a doubtful tone.

"Forms aren't for combat, they are to reinforce familiarity towards movements," the woman retorted with a sneer. "How can you not know that?"

"It's because I don't practice any martial arts," Marie confessed casually.

The woman's face shrunk into a point with incredulity. "Not even one? How do you fight?"

"I don't fight," Marie shrugged.

"A mage who doesn't fight..." the woman muttered in a volume that was intended to be unheard, but was just loud enough for Marie to register. There was an overbearing flavour of derision in those words that wasn't missed by Marie, who exhaled mirthfully.

Marie decided to entertain the woman a little. So with a faint smile, she probed "Why would I need to fight?"

"To protect yourself. To protect your loved ones. To get what you want! Amongst other thing..." The woman rattled in quick succession. Her fervour grew with each point she made as though she were offended by the mere thought of being untrained in combat.

"So, if I can protect myself, my loved ones, AND get what I want without fighting, does that mean I don't need to train in martial arts or any such fighting techniques?" Marie proposed.

The woman's already contorted expression twitched and warped even more at the sheer nonsense exiting Marie's mouth. A few scoffs and unintelligible sounds exited her own mouth as she formulated, and failed to execute a befitting response.

"You don't believe me, do you?" Marie asked rhetorically. "Let me see..." Marie's eyes narrowed onto the woman's form - to the woman, it appeared as though Marie was looking right through her. It was unnerving, like suddenly being nude and exposed, however, she didn't feel any mana sense probing her.

"Hmm, you're a ballsy one," Marie blurted out. "But I bet juggling the two men at the same time can get exhausting."

"W-What?! How-"

"If I were you, I would go for the younger one. Sure, an age gap of eight may seem like much now, but as you grow older it will seem insignificant. Besides, the boy practically worships you. Furthermore, the other one is juggling three women, and you aren't even amongst those three, so... take that as you will," Marie narrated before patting the woman's shoulder sympathetically.

"How?" The woman parroted with a gulp.

Marie chuckled and said, "I don't need to fight, because people are their own worst enemies. Any ways, we should probably get moving."

The sect's campus was massive and so was its population - it was like a city. It because evident very quickly that the sect specialised in martial arts of many kinds, including unarmed and armed styles. Their toured passed by many such practising grounds with ordered hordes of people going through Forms both simple and complex. There were facilities for Alchemy and other magical ventures, but their scope was measly compared to the martial departments.

But what really poked at Marie's curiosity was, "How do you guys recruit and get so many people here? Do you know how many hoops we had to jump through to hitch a ride? And the damn thing didn't even reach this place!"

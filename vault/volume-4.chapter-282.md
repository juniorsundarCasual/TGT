Jean and Josie put on hazmat type suits they made for themselves.

Jean and Josie arrive at a dilapidated village.

Death everywhere, rats running around eating away the dead bodies.

The move ahead and arrive at another village. The result is the same.

The quarantined area is vast. Along the way, they meet people running swarming to escape and save themselves, but none were being allowed to leave. Some showed signs of infection already. Jean decides that she should try her best to heal them.

Jean and Josie set up a treatment camp. They separate those with signs of infection from those that aren't. Proceed to run battery of test on bodily fluid samples in hopes of deducing a way to cure the sickness.

A solution is evident via alchemy, however it is highly toxic to non-magical folk without the ability to circulate their mana. Saving them using this method is no worse than the sickness.

After much consideration, Jean determines that this sickness is what Mister Larks defined as a viral infection. The cause is a virus. Extracting learned knowledge, she determines that there is an interaction happening at the cellular level. After inspecting the blood and fluid samples of the infected, she observes the cellular interaction taking place. However, Jean lacks the sufficient knowledge to synthesise a solution to inhibit this process since she does not have the required prerequisite knowledge.

Knowledge can be accumulated but it takes time. Time is something they lack. A stopgap solution needs to be implemented.

Jean decides to approach this problem with two prongs. She enlists Josie's assistance to narrow down the way the virus spreads. She confirms that transmission is through body-fluid, however there is evidence of the virus popping up in multiple places at once according to some reports.

Josie finds out that it is caused by specially bio-engineered rats with specialised sacks that cultivate and hold the dormant virus. Thus begins the complete eradication of rodentkind.

Jean struggles to find a cure, but she stumbles upon a child taking care of an infected mother who is the verge of death. The child shows no signs of infection even after being in contact with a victim for so long. Jean theorises that the child has something inside her that is stopping the illness from developing. Using the child's fluid samples, she isolates the antibodies. She realises, though, that this process is not scalable as it would require her to use the child as a well. Thus, she decides to enlist her family's help which requires her to send a package. The nearest town offers an instant teleportation service.

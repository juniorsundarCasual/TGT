Before Josie departed, Jean and she immediately went about cleansing the area with the aerosolised disinfectant and set up a large group of triage tents to manage the treatment of the infected. As it stood, those affected by the disease were spread out within the quarantined region. It would be inefficient to administer and manage care in this dispersed state, so the first order of business would be to herd the affected into a cohesive area.

Why was this preferred? Wouldn't this increase the chances of spreading the illness amongst the population? That would be true if the herding was done haphazardly.

Managing any disease or epidemic can be achieved through passive or active means. The former involves establishing general guidelines that an individual or group must follow to prevent the spread and proliferation of an illness. This is usually generic and preventative in nature, in that there is no targeted action involved. Wearing facial coverings, maintaining safe working distances, cleaning oneself regularly, and not eating food that is left uncovered for a long time fall under this category. 

Active management is more aggressive and targeted in its approach. However, this also means that it is often more rigorous to implement. But it can be boiled down to a three-step process: identifying the disease, combating the disease, and preventing it from occurring again.

Identifying the disease involves learning everything there is to know about the disease. Where did it start? How does it spread? How does it enter and affect the human body? These are few of the questions that must be addressed first, as they determine the efficacy of the response.

After identifying the source, it must either be contained or eliminated to stop it from resurging again.

Before Josie departed, Jean and she immediately went about cleansing the area with the aerosolised disinfectant and set up a large group of triage tents to manage the treatment of the infected. As it stood, those affected by the disease were spread out within the quarantined region. It would be inefficient to administer and manage care in this dispersed state, so the first order of business would be to herd the affected into a cohesive area.

Why was this preferred? Wouldn't this increase the chances of spreading the illness amongst the population? That would be true if the herding was done haphazardly.

Managing any disease or epidemic can be achieved through passive or active means. The former involves establishing general guidelines that an individual or group must follow to prevent the spread and proliferation of an illness. This is usually generic and preventative in nature, in that there is no targeted action involved. Wearing facial coverings, maintaining safe working distances, cleaning oneself regularly, and not eating food that is left uncovered for a long time fall under this category. 

Active management is more aggressive and targeted in its approach. However, this also means that it is often more rigorous to implement. But it can be boiled down to a three-step process: identifying the disease, combating the disease, and preventing it from occurring again.

Identifying the disease involves learning everything there is to know about the disease. Where did it start? How does it spread? How does it enter and affect the human body? These are few of the questions that must be addressed first, as they determine the efficacy of the response.

It is important to identify the source of the epidemic so that it can be properly contained or eliminated altogether. This is to avoid causing a resurgence of the same epidemic while it is being managed. Josie had confirmed with certainty that the creature she had just battled was the instigator of this illness. For all intents and purposes, the source had been eliminated, so Jean shouldn't need to worry about the illness rearing its head once again. However, Josie said in no uncertain terms that the creature could have escaped. Although this was still an uncertainty, Jean could not discount the possibility even if it was minuscule. But she could do nothing for now except depend on Josie to handle the leg work of finding and eliminating the source in the meanwhile.

The next order of business is identifying how the illness propagates and restricting that avenue. This is to limit the spread temporarily so that those affected can be treated without having to worry about new - preventable - cases. This is where the herding of the affected comes into play. Instead of grouping everyone into one tent or room, the incoming horde (as herded by Josie as she travelled all over the quarantine) was split into three categories. The first were the ones showing symptoms of the infection, the second were those suspected of being exposed but asymptomatic and the third were the unexposed and asymptomatic. 

The first group was easy to deduce. The symptoms of this particular illness wasn't paced in its progression; it went from zero all the way to a hundred within a span of days. As a result there were very few in the group displaying signs of the illness. The ones that did were on their last legs, and Jean could do very little except for offering a diluted drop from the Draught of Living Death - an extremely concentrated potion capable of putting even an erumpent to a comatose sleep with a human-sized mouthful.

The second and third group were tougher to distinguish. In both cases, the suspects were asymptomatic so judging through a cursory glance was impossible. Furthermore, the folk refused to answer questions truthfully. When Jean urged them to declare if they had even been exposed to the illness in any way, they all shook their heads and moved towards the third tent. When she added that those in second tent would receive primary care, they all moved towards that tent. 

In the end, Jean was forced to step in and enforce some order amongst the din. She decided to go with the most effective strategy of running blood tests on all those present to see if there were any indicators of their illness in their system.

This carried on to the third part of identifying the illness, which was to actually determine its nature and behaviour. This is to determine the optimal treatment strategy. In learning under Mister Larks, Jean learned that the three primary causes of acquired illnesses in people are through bacteria, fungi and viruses. This knowledge broadened Jean's horizons vastly. Through her research with her father, she'd somehow stumbled upon these three culprits. She had already noted the differences through her observations, but she didn't classify them accordingly. However, by assigning a classification and name, her understanding of how to treat illnesses induced by these three improved marginally.

For diseases caused by bacteria, specialised antibiotics are usually the preferred treatment method. The same way, antifungals work for fungal infections. For viruses, the preferred method is through antivirals. Antibiotics, antifungals and antiviruses offer three different treatment pathways depending on the type of infection since bacteria, fungi and viruses work in different ways.

After learning the mechanism of how these medicines worked, she returned to her research and inspected the potions she knew and worked with. The ones that were effective in treating the illnesses classified as bacteria, fungi and viruses all worked similar to how they were expected to according to their respective treatment pathways. The answer was right in front of her, she just didn't know what to look for!

The mana sense is truly a wonderful piece of magic. Every mage is essentially gifted access to all the knowledge in the world, except it remains indecipherable until the mage learns how to process it. Gaining further insight into the microbiological world was a great revelation for Jean. Though it wasn't so revolutionary to induce a breakthrough, as she was knowledgable about it form before but to a limited degree.

Jean could run blood tests purely with her mana senses now, since she knew what to look for. With fluids extracted from those already infected (pus fluid), as well as those

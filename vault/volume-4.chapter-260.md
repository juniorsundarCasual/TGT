What she saw was a future set in stone according to the laws of Constants. It took her a few scrubbing operations - the process of going forward and back in time multiple times in varying speeds - for her to truly grasp the underlying facts behind the gruesome and dreary scene.

The True World Sect would grow quickly and, in that process, so would its reputation. The Sect would rise above others in its generation and gain enough prestige to challenge the more renowned sects in the Solar Empire. However, achieving such success wouldn't be without cost. Envy is a toxic emotion, and one that the sect would be subject to by its competitors.

There is a reason why no new sects have risen to the level of Cloudstrider Sect or the Whispering Dusk Sect ever since the origin of the Empire. The competition between sects is brutal and unforgiving. When the True World Sect eventually reaches the springboard, ready to hit the big leagues, it will face repeated opposition from other sects.

Sect Leader Larks will become famous. Mortals will flock from far and wide to learn under him because of Sect Leader Larks' policies about admission and learning magic. The status quo will become destabilised, and it will incur the ire of the government as well. After all, the Empire thrives off of the illiteracy of the large majority of common-folk. If a rogue entity like Sect Leader Lars entered the scene, then the only crutch that keeps the leaders in power will disappear.

Which leads to the predicament from earlier. The True World Sect will become embroiled in a conflict from two fronts. Both sides will try to undermine Sect Leader Larks. They will do so by labelling the True World Sect as an unorthodox sect because of Sect Leader Larks' special ability to control others. This way, the True World Sect will lose everything, though it will not be annihilated.

Marie was certain that Sect Leader Larks wouldn't perish. As her Master said, the True World Sect would propagate, albeit with a different set of members. The True World Sect would thrive, but it wouldn't be without some initial bloodshed. As a Constant, this massacre was an eventuality. It could arrive today, or it could arrive as I lay in my deathbed.

BUT, Marie did not want that. She did not wish to lose her family. This problem needed fixing. But how?

Marie exited her mental space with a thoughtful frown on her face. She caught her Master's impressed expression and decided to cut to the chase.

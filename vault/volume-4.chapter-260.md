While Marie immersed herself in the dour vision of the future, something profound was transpiring within her that went unnoticed by her, though its effects on the outside world couldn't be so easily missed.

A sizeable whirlpool of mana started to form around Marie and started to siphon into her. The temperature in and around her started to rise noticeably. Sweat started to ooze out from her pores that started out a cloudy, translucent shade and suddenly turned murky black and vaporised immediately after. In doing so, holes started to form all around her attire, as the material disintegrated at a rapid pace.

Krish couldn't help but take a step back with a mix of shock, awe and disbelief. His Disciple was achieving a breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm. Fundamentally, a breakthrough from Mana Condensation Realm only occurs when a mage understands something incredibly profound about their cultivation. Their mind expands, and the body must keep up. Thus, a thorough cleansing is initiated that spans the entirety of the Foundation Establishment Realm. First it is the Base stage that cleanses the circulatory and nervous systems. The mana burns away all impurities ailing the mage which exits their bodies as a corrosive black liquid. The Internal stage is the second step in Foundation Establishment, that reinforces the internal organs and the bones. The External stage is the last, wherein the muscles, tendons, flesh and everything external gets empowered.

At that moment, Krish caught himself and immediately activated the Heavenly Eye. His gaze ran rampant, everywhere and searched for any sign of deviation or redirection of fate. Usually, for a practitioner of the Heavenly Eye to break through, they needed to shift the course of fate irreversibly in some way and suffer the backlash from their actions. This was the only way to gain a profound understanding of fate as it exemplified a fundamental truth: fate is set in stone and to change it one must sacrifice something of equal value.

To his utter surprise, the world was moving as it was - fate had remained unchanged. And this realisation shattered his thought paradigm completely. To know that there was an alternate pathway, one without loss, well... He would be lying if he wasn't a bit envious. Envy, a rather caustic emotion and one that mages are quick to succumb to. Krish immediately smothered it in its crib after telling himself that all of this was achieved through the gruelling hardwork of his Disciple. It was a befitting reward. If there was anyone to blame, it could only be himself. If he had tried a different strategy from the start, he could have achieved the same thing

That was a lie.

First off, his Master would have none of it. He wasn't the least bit patient or sympathetic. If Marie were under his Master, she would have been deleted at the first sign of opposition. His Master would no sooner get rid of such an "impudent" Disciple than entertain her many flights of fancy. Now even if his Master gained a shred of empathy and decided to indulge in such endeavours, there was still a massive piece missing. It was the knowledge, especially the unique way of thinking, that gave Marie the ability to snag this achievement. Krish could not match his Disciple because he lacked a man like Guy Larks in his youth.

What she saw was a future set in stone according to the laws of Constants. It took her a few scrubbing operations - the process of going forward and back in time multiple times in varying speeds - for her to truly grasp the underlying facts behind the gruesome and dreary scene.

The True World Sect would grow quickly and, in that process, so would its reputation. The Sect would rise above others in its generation and gain enough prestige to challenge the more renowned sects in the Solar Empire. However, achieving such success wouldn't be without cost. Envy is a toxic emotion, and one that the sect would be subject to by its competitors.

There is a reason why no new sects have risen to the level of Cloudstrider Sect or the Whispering Dusk Sect ever since the origin of the Empire. The competition between sects is brutal and unforgiving. When the True World Sect eventually reaches the springboard, ready to hit the big leagues, it will face repeated opposition from other sects.

Sect Leader Larks will become famous. Mortals will flock from far and wide to learn under him because of Sect Leader Larks' policies about admission and learning magic. The status quo will become destabilised, and it will incur the ire of the government as well. After all, the Empire thrives off of the illiteracy of the large majority of common-folk. If a rogue entity like Sect Leader Lars entered the scene, then the only crutch that keeps the leaders in power will disappear.

Which leads to the predicament from earlier. The True World Sect will become embroiled in a conflict from two fronts. Both sides will try to undermine Sect Leader Larks. They will do so by labelling the True World Sect as an unorthodox sect because of Sect Leader Larks' special ability to control others. This way, the True World Sect will lose everything, though it will not be annihilated.

Marie was certain that Sect Leader Larks wouldn't perish. As her Master said, the True World Sect would propagate, albeit with a different set of members. The True World Sect would thrive, but it wouldn't be without some initial bloodshed. As a Constant, this massacre was an eventuality. It could arrive today, or it could arrive as I lay in my deathbed.

BUT, Marie did not want that. She did not wish to lose her family. This problem needed fixing. But how?

Marie exited her mental space with a thoughtful frown on her face. She caught her Master's impressed expression and decided to cut to the chase.

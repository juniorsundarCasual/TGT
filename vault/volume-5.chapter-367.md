The Sect Leader was being unusually animated these days. It all started from the day the seven rule-breakers were called in for fighting amongst themselves. That day marked the first time everyone in the Sect truly saw the Sect Leader's furious expression. Usually, the man was a pillar of tranquillity and nigh-infinite patience. But that day, they saw a different expression blooming on the man's mien. People often say that it is the ones that smile and project an outwardly unperturbed aura that are the scariest when angered. The commotion that day proved that idiom true.

A booming voice yelled, "Stop this farce this instant!"

The dust cloud caused by the tussling teens on the ground dispersed almost instantly, revealing the ragged and bruised septet. The twins had ganged up on Krane, with Casey sitting on his chest and Lacey holding down his legs. Kevan and Norris were in a slapping match, which was largely pointless as they were standing beyond slapping distance. Revian had a fistful of Luce's hair in his hands, while she had him in a chokehold. The loud reprimand, however, put a halt to the childish fight, and the observing crowd split down the middle to reveal the enraged Sect Leader.

The man's eyeballs were practically popping out of their sockets and were died an angry red as their veins bulged out. His expression had warped significantly from the usual serene smile, revealing a more dangerous dour frown. He walked forward with heavy steps as he approached the miscreants.

"What is all this?" He asked forcefully, gesturing at the ruckus the seven had caused. He then turned to the gawking audience and said, "Do you lot have nothing better to do?!"

The crowd dissipated instantaneously, lest the Sect Leader's overflowing anger redirects their way.

"You seven!" He said. His gaze piercing into the souls of the seven before him. "I want you clean yourselves this instant and come to the administrative office immediately after. If I hear from anyone about you guys causing any more trouble-"

He did not finish the sentence. He did not need to finish that sentence. The sentence basically finished itself in all their minds.

The Sect Leader did not waste another second

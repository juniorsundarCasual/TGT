The words of assurance spoken by his Master did little to relieve the stress accumulating within Markus. His mind was in flux, preoccupied over a myriad of thoughts, though nearly all of them boiled down to the singular question: "Will I be able to handle all those people until Master arrives?"

Markus greatest fear was disappointing his Master. While his Master vehemently asserted that Markus could do no wrong, that simple statement actually amplified the burden bearing down on his gut. It was the burden of expectation. Markus feared that he wouldn't live up to his Master's perception of him. Markus didn't believe himself to be as capable and authoritative as his Master believed him to be. He didn't think he was competent enough to teach those barely a few years younger than him properly. What if he taught incorrectly and ruined their basics?

Such thoughts swam through his mind, causing the already unpleasant and bumpy ride to grow increasingly tumultuous. The early stretch from the Capital till the forests was headache inducing, given the unbearable traffic. However, as they reach the periphery of the Central Plains, the caravans and carriages started to disperse along different paths as their final destinations diverged. After the carriage entered the familiar path, Markus let himself dissolve into his thoughts and allowed his overactive imagination to process through all possible situations he could experience during his time training the new recruits and bringing them up to speed.

What to do when someone refuses to obey and acts rebellious? What if someone has difficulty reading and writing, like Kano? What to do with the blind boy? He remembered his Master talking about a tactile writing system that could be used by people that were visually impaired - he would have to visit the Sect's Library and brush up on that topic. What to do if the recruits become dissatisfied and choose to leave? What if-? What if-? What if-?

Surprisingly formulating solution to all those "what if's" actually alleviated some of Markus' anxiety. Just knowing that he was prepared for every scenario, no matter how absurd, filled him with some confidence. After a point, the "what if's" started to barrel out of control and Markus had to take out a few pages from his Grimoire to jot down his plan of action with more detail. His handwriting was abysmal thanks to the bumpiness of the ride, which got so bad that Markus dropped his "counterattack" strategising spree and started to brainstorm possible solutions to cushion the vibrations of carriages such as this one without having to rely on expensive enchantments.

"Maybe springs?" But that would agitate the carriage further. The purpose of this device should be to damp the vibrations. "Maybe some form of hydraulics?" There were no bad ideas in brainstorming, and true to that motto, many absurd ideas started to occupy real-estate in the sheet of paper.

This process extended for a while as Markus lost track of the time. But he was immediately pulled out of his inspired state, when the carriage halted with a sudden jolt.

"What's the matter?" Markus inquired the drive while peeking through the grill at the front of the covered carriage.

"The path appears to be blocked, Sir," the driver responded.

Markus furrowed his brows as he descended from the carriage. As the driver said, the path truly was blocked. A massive tree had collapsed and completely shut-off the usually trodden path. Markus climbed over the fallen log and was shocked to see utter carnage extending as far as his sights could reach. Trees uprooted, the ground wrecked to kingdom-come, and suspicious damage markers caused by a feline beast claw and human weapons of various kinds.

"What in the world?" His eyes caught movement in the distance. Flashing lights, a loud rumble, and then the ground physically shook. After meditating and letting his ears hone in that general direction, he managed to catch the muffled sounds of metal hitting something hard but not exactly metal. He was intrigued and definitely interested to see what exactly was happening that caused this mini-disaster, but Markus' survival instincts took precedence.

"We cannot go down this path. I could clear the wreckage, but it would be unwise to intercept a fight between what appears to be a group of mages and a Magical Beast," Markus commented while approaching the carriage. "Do you know of an alternative?"

The driver scratched his chin contemplatively before suggesting, "There is another path that cuts through the denser parts of the forest, but I wouldn't suggest it. I've heard that some bandits have recently set up camp in those parts."

"Are there mages amongst these bandits?" Markus probed.

"I don't think so..." the man responded more certain than uncertain.

"Well, I can't afford to delay my arrival. I say we take this riskier path," Markus declared. "I'll compensate you for the trouble."

"This detour will only affect the hazard pay. Please sign the contract in the box underneath your seat to agree that any changes to said hazard pay is at the driver's discretion," the driver responded.

"You have a contract prepared for THIS instance?" Markus blurted out incredulously.

"Boaz Transports are always prepared," the man droned in a practised manner.

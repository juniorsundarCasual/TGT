Temptation wasn't something Shuri had to fight against during her time at the Palace. Over there, the paths were clear-cut; it was easy to predict what would lead to death and what wouldn't. But in the True World Sect, where she was afforded a level of freedom she'd never experienced before, Shuri didn't know what to do. The peril hidden behind the many temptations hanging before her were hidden deeply, beneath levels of subterfuge that even her lifetime's worth of experience couldn't unravel.

But one thing was for certain, though. The Library wasn't safe. Not yet at least. It was filled with unseen and unheard of knowledge that urged her to learn more, and keep digging deeper. Worse yet, there was nothing stopping her from doing it. It was like hanging a bloody and juicy steak in front of a wolf that has already had a taste of the meat. Thankfully, Shuri wasn't beholden to her base urges. Knowledge had a price, and Shuri was certain that all that information enshrined within the majestic walls of the Library would exact their dues in time.

To distract herself, Shuri opted to follow Markus' suggestion and indulged in the many recreational activities the Sect had to offer. Unfortunately, this meant that she had to interact with her "colleagues". Luckily, the kids who joined the Sect with her were common folk. The conversations she could hold with them didn't require her to unwind a complicated thread of subtlety. They spoke straightforwardly, and without the use of doublespeak - a sentence had a single meaning.

"Are you going to eat all of that?" Wasn't a jab at her physical appearance. It was literally a question inquiring if she was going to eat the large mound of rice on her plate. It was refreshing... But it only elevated Shuri's wariness. Things were moving far too swimmingly for her comfort.

The "board games" she played were unbearably trivial. She had to hold herself back from winning sometimes to avoid attracting attention. She needed to blend into the crowd, after all. The physically involved games were much harder on Shuri given her weaker frame, but that didn't exclude her from playing. There was always a position for her to apply herself, which was mostly in the form of strategy and game planning. Even there, she had to constantly hold herself back from using highly sacrificial plays and aggressive tactics to not draw the interest of Markus and Matron Reva.

The days passed like this, and Shuri slowly started to assimilate with the routine followed by the Sect. The Sect published a schedule she needed to follow until the return of the Sect Leader and the official kickoff of sect activities. This involved morning and evening Yoga, an interesting and highly effective meditation technique that also doubled as a stretching and physical exercise, literacy review and crash course in basic mathematics, study on the basics of magic and cultivation, and recreation and self-development time. The timings for the study and meditation sessions were rigid, while the rest were fluid where she was basically left to her own devices.

During her self-development time, Shuri resumed her frequent trips to the Library. She had managed to get a hold of her temptations - the recreation time with her peers worked as suitable distraction. She also found some interest in the Maker-Space, that was filled with tools and machines she hadn't seen or heard of before. With Markus' guidance, she learned to use the lathe and milling machine, and even created simple items such as door-handles and decorative plates. The area was extremely conducive to research, experimentation, and development.

Unknowingly, Shuri's robust guard had withered to a point where she didn't question every action and decision in her daily life. This was the result of the uplifting and supportive learning environment.

On one particular day, while Shuri skipped towards the Maker-Space, her sensitive ears caught wind of a commotion originating from the Administrative area, close to the Sect's entrance. She even saw a few kids running in that direction excitedly.

Kano looked at Dodi with a blank gaze. His attention then alternated between the rectangular slab and the expectant woman holding a chisel confidently.

"Go on, then," Kam urged while patting Kano on his shoulder. "Explain everything, leave out no detail. The more descriptive and personal it is, the better."

After a few minutes of silence, Kam finally realised Kano's confusion.

"We're basically building your identity right now. In order to do so, you need a history. We are establishing that for you right now."

"Are you going to chisel it into stone?" Kano probed. It was at that instant that Kam understood the culture shock. Just earlier Kano had talked about books and knowledge transfer through written means.

Kam gave off a wry smile and said, "Dodi here is a trained Empath. As you evoke your history, she will seamlessly place herself in your boots and experience the scenarios herself. She will feel the same things you do and sense hte same things you do, as long as your description is clear and in-depth. She will then use this shared experience to etch your story into the identification tablet right there."

"An Empath?" Kano asked curiously.

"Any skilled Enchanter can instill their experiences and stories into their work. That is the crux of enchanting, after all. But not every Enchanter can live in the boots of another and instill their experiences to stone, metal, or what have you. The one thing they cannot do, is speak on someoneelse's behalf. After all, an experience cannot be shared if you aren't present to experience it yourself. For an Empath, though, this isn't the case," Kam explained. "An Empath is a skill gained through a Special Physique. You respond strongly to some emotions, even if you aren't the one who has lived through it. It isn't particularly a rare physique, as one in every one-thousand dwarf is found to have that ability. But is a well sought after position in the government. Everyone you see that works as a Clerk is an Empath. You can say being one guarantees you a rather cushy and stable job."

At that moment, Dodi reached over the counter and swatted the back of Kam's head. "You make it sound like I just lucked into this job."

She then turned to Kano and added, "Highly attuned empathy is both a blessing and a curse. It is a wild ability that triggers while you're listening to someone talk about their day. I once cried myself to near death after listening to my great-granduncle talk about his struggles during the Great War and the trauma that still lingered. They train you to be more targeted with your empathy here. Its an arduous course that pushes you to a mental breakpoint - they break you compeltely before you are remade into the stone-like entity you see before you today."

She cleared her throat and said, "Now then, let us get back to business. As Kam, said, keep your explanations descriptive. The more descriptive they are the easier it will be for me."

Kano nodded thoughtfully and started and asked, "Where should I begin?"

"You can start as far as you can remember or from the time you came to the Fel Realm. I leave the depth of your history up to you. Though I must warn you to not flourish you accounts with untrue events. If you don't wish to reveal details from your past, I would suggest that you skip them. As an Empath, I can catch mistruths and lies very easily. However, I must warn you that if there are dependencies in the story that you reveal with the parts that you skip, then it will mess everything up as well. All-in-all, think clearly before you speak and be truthful," Dodi warned.

"The earliest memory I have is of hunger," Kano explained. "Let me tell a little about myself. I am Kano Reva, and I am an orphan. I am also one of two, that is, I have a twin sister. She is probably somewhere, I hope that she's safe and finds people to protect her like Kam did with me. My sister and I were orphaned as babies. I don't know why or how. My adopted mother did not share a lot of details about our pasts beyond the fact that she found us in our cradles in a broken down carriage in the middle of a forest. She said that the sight was eerie, there were no signs of an attack, human, animal or otherwise. I don't know if I was abandoned, or if my parents were killed in some struggle. Regardless, Matron Reva likes to say that we were a gift for her. The world could not place us in her belly so it placed us in her path instead."

As Kano narrated, something magical happened before him. The moment Dodi's chisel hit the tablet, an ethereal copy of the stone burst out and grew out before her. On this ethereal, purple projection, Kano saw Dodi's chisel marks taking shape. Surprisingly these marks did not show on the tablet. Kano stared in awe at the display filling up his visual space.

"The identification tablet is magically crafted with multiple layers of thin stone merged together with magican reagents. I cannot tell you the exact process, not because I don't want to but because it is far too complicated for you to understand. Basically, Dodi is etching into one of the layers that comprise this tablet. The magic lets her do that, and because of that you cannot see the immediate effect of her etching on the topmost layer-"

"Stop distracting the boy and let him speak!" Dodi barked while still concentrating on her task.

"As I said before, my earliest memories have been of hunger. Matron Reva carried a heavy burden of supporting a large family all on her own. But even under it, she never gave up. She didn't quit. She tried her best, and we could see that, which was enough. It was enough to know that we were wanted and loved by someone. But love and support can't fill in an empty stomach. And hunger can make you do... a lot of things that people would consider wrong."

Kano looked at Kam with a distressed and embarrassed expression.

The girl barely managed to eke out a question before she collapsed due to exhaustion. Markus reverted from his rage-filled stupor and beheld the carnage wrought of his wrath. What were once robust human bodies had now turned into crumpled up messes of flesh, blood and crushed bones. These were the first men Markus had killed. He'd expected a more visceral reaction, but maybe because of the pumping adrenaline, he felt absolutely nothing. In fact, he felt little sympathy for these dead beasts in human skin. They deserved this for what they were about to do- what they may have been doing even before Markus stumbled upon them.

Markus did not like being violent. He'd been on the receiving end of it for a good part of his childhood. But the world he lived in was not conducive to a person with a non-violent demeanour. Therefore, what happened today was ultimately an eventuality in Markus' opinion - he'd either take a life now, or later. Nonetheless, his hands would be stained in blood. He was only thankful that the reason for that was to protect an innocent soul and not to further a selfish agenda.

"Umm, excuse me... ma'am?" Markus said while nudging the unconscious girl with his wand. He cautiously extended his hand towards her neck to check her pulse, when suddenly the girl's eyes flashed open and her arm shot out with malicious intensity. Thankfully, Markus was in the Foundation Establishment realm or he would have suffered from a ruptured jugular vein and eventual death. Markus moved his head back by a centimetre as the small, finger-sized knife that slid out of the inner-lining of the girl's sleeve breezed past it.

"Woah! Relax, I am not going to hurt you!" Markus said while leaping a few steps back.

"Who are you? What do you want?" The girl demanded with a feral madness in her eyes, one that was missing when she was... being held down against her will.

"You had this with you all along?" Markus asked while nudging his eyes towards the dagger. "You'd have taken at least one down with you."

"The world isn't a safe place," the girl responded matter-of-factly. "A girl needs to know how to protect herself."

A sudden gust of wind blew through the area, dislodging the girl's torn clothes and revealing excessive skin. Markus coughed before removing his outer coat and threw it towards the girl. "You should cover yourself. As night is approaching, it will get much colder."

The girl obliged without hesitation and covered herself with the coat, which was two sizes too large for her.

"Which way are you headed? We're moving Northeast, towards Radiant City. If your destination is along the way, why don't you join us?" Markus offered.

The girl narrowed her eyes and shot out an evaluating glare that unnerved Markus. He felt completely exposed in front of her gaze that was more invasive than an uncontrolled mana sense.

"Why?" The girl asked.

"Why... what?"

"Why are you helping me?"

Markus eyes widened in dumbfounded shock, "Because... it is the right thing to do."

The girl's jaw dropped in disbelief before she schooled her expression with a knowing smirk. "Well. Thank you, I am grateful for your assistance. I appreciate the ride, but could you please help retrieve my belongings? It should probably be amidst the wreckage a few kilometres that way."

The 'right' thing. Who decided what was right and what was wrong? It was all subjective. Only those with power could dictate the rules, that was the fact of life. Shuri decided to place some faith on the naive boy who had ultimately saved her, and followed him as guided her towards his carriage. He offered to carry her, as she stumbled multiple times with her still shaking and bruised legs, but she denied it immediately - she didn't feel like being 'handled' right now.

The boy wasn't hard to read, he practically wore his emotions on his sleeves - he wouldn't survive a second in the palace. But Shuri preferred this, as it made her life much easier.

"My name's Markus, by the way," the boy offered. He'd slowed his pace down significantly, probably in consideration towards Shuri's injuries.  Shuri looked at the boy who had her luggage hanging over his shoulders, and decided not to respond to the question.

"Hmm... I get it. You are suspicious of me. That's okay," the boy- Markus said with a shrugged. "But I'd really like to assign you a name in my mind instead of referring to you as just 'girl'," he added with a chuckle, though that diminished when she didn't entertain that sorry excuse towards humour.

The carriage came into view twenty minutes after leaving the location of the attack.

"Master Mage," the driver called out worriedly. "Umm... who might this be?"

"She's..." Markus looked towards me expectantly, and Shuri ignored him once again.

"*cough* This young lady here was ambushed by bandits. Her ride has been totalled, so I offered her a ride till her destination."

The driver sighed and said, "The contract was for a single client. A second passenger changes the deal." He then reached to his side and retrieved a stack of papers, probably a contract.

Markus groaned loudly, "Alright, how much is it?"

"I can cover my share," Shuri interjected.

"No! I can't possibly-"

"It is the least I can do after what you've done for me," Shuri interjected once again. She played towards Markus' inherently kind nature. She didn't want to feel indebted to the boy, not more than she already was.

After some internal debating, that was as clear as day on the boy's transparent face, he relented. And with that decided, and the contracts signed, Shuri ascended up the carriage and rested herself closest to the exit. She was feeling drowsy. And though she wanted to remain awake, especially when amidst strange new company, her body was not in the mood to listen. Sleep took her almost immediately.

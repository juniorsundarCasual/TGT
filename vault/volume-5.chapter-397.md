While the entire Sect indulged in the strenuous lessons on combat, Shuri was holed up in a secluded corner of the Sect working on an elaborate project.

It all started out as a faint idea - the concept of combining digital signals to build data. Binary could be used to represent nearly anything. Having a physical way to represent this binary data, and being able to read and write it would essentially create the data storage system she needed. She had to wrack her brain for days to figure out a valid plan of attack.

First, she limited her search to topics familiar to her, which was mostly Automagy. Programming mana cores was in her wheelhouse, but she could not imagine a program that could be used as a dense data storage device with read-write capabilities. She harkened to the idea of the modular spellcasting device - the Magi-Core - she built for Yohn. The data contained had to be hard-coded into the core. Furthermore, the modular spells built by reorienting the device would reset once the spell was cast. There was no inherent way to build in information storage in Automagy as once the core deactivated, it would reset. Even golems, considered to be the pinnacle of Automagic application, perform a set or preprogrammed series of tasks repeatedly - even the most advanced ones have a limited range of tasks they can accomplish.

Therefore, she took a step back and explored all adjacent topics, of which Enchanting appeared to be the closest. Enchanting offered an avenue. Jean knew that mages could engrave messages, audio or video, inside mana gems. They could edit the messages as well, which meant that reading and writing were possible. Furthermore, it was possible to ensure that even if the mana gem isn't constantly powered with mana, it wouldn't lose the data within.

Shuri could have stopped there, but she decided to dig deeper. Shuri was patient. It was one of her most endearing traits. It was also the reason why she survived for so long in the Palace. Although the Sect had corroded a large portion of her patience, it was still engraved into her bones. In total, she had spent five days brainstorming for solutions. She figured wasting another day wouldn't make much difference in the grand scheme of things.

Through sheer coincidence, Shuri stumbled upon a book about Ritual Formations in the Library. It was just lying in the middle of the desk there, and she decided to place it back in its shelf. On the way there, she perused through its contents, as she hadn't read this one before. Due to her eidetic memory, even a brief read could engrave the contents into her brain. And it did. By the time she reached the shelf, she had finished it cover to cover, but she did not place the book in its place just yet as another idea struck her.

She quickly rushed back to the desk and pulled out a large roll of parchment and her writing utensil. Then, her hand flourished over the blank page, filling it up with intricate diagrams as the convoluted thoughts in her mind started to imprint themselves on it. Ritual formations, mana gems, and mana cores are all similar in the way they work but have different application cases. They can all be used to cast a spell, but the

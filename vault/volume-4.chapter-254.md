"Senior Sister, please! You shouldn't have to do this," the Shay-Hade appealed anxiously. Marie noticed that his accent was a bit similar to that of the man from the Jehakan Confederacy that fleeced her out of those silver coins for a measly doll. Though his appearance did not match the turban-garbed man. Shay-Hade was tall for a seventeen year-old, he was towering over Mage Maddi by atleast two heads. He had a bulky build, his ebony skin accentuating the bulging musculature as the sunlight reflected off of it at the correct angles. His ankle-length hair, which was showing silver shades at his roots, was tied into dreadlocks that formed a tight bun on his head before cascading till his upper back.

"This spar happens to be called in my name," Mage Maddi pointed out. "Why must others represent my interests when I am capable of doing it myself."

"That's not it!" Shay-Hade quickly waved his hands in denial. "This is just beneath you."

"It is beneath me. Which is why I will make this quick," Mage Maddi noted offhandedly.

"Aren't we being presumptuous-"

"Shut it, Royce! What was the decided upon format for the bout?"

Mage Royce scoffed and said, "It was going to be Freestyle. But the gentleman that I am, I will offer you a mulligan."

"Aren't you a generous one," Mage Maddi scoffed back with an incisive tone. Then, her lips quirk upwards deviously. "I called for a Chained Pugilism."

The crowd gasped in unison. Evidently, this type of bout was common knowledge here, though not so for Marie.

"What's Chained Pugilism?" Marie nudged the person next to her and asked, though she did not receive a response as the person just growled and moved away.

Mage Maddi and Royce approached each other and extended their left legs forward. A third person entered the ring and got on their knees. They tied the two left legs together with a heavy chain hanging over their shoulders. The moment the chain link revolved around the legs, it fastened and tightened to match the girth. The duo tried pulling their legs apart and were met with insurmountable resistance.

"The spar will follow standard Sect protocols. Victory conditions are through admission of defeat or knockout."

A pause.

"Begin!"

The moment the fight moderator called the start of the bout, the sound of flesh colliding against flesh (though both were reinforced with mana) rang out from the field. Mage Maddi's fist struck Mage Royce's lower rib, right over where his stomach would be. She in turn received a haymaker to her left cheek. Marie flinched at the brutal upper body strike, but Mage Maddi did not even twitch.

The attacks continued. Fists connected against bodies emitting sounds akin to the booming of a leather drum. There was no flashiness, no embellishment, no outward displays of magic, just pure and unadultered violence. The exchange went like a choreographed dance, each side's push and infrequent open-palm strikes and swipes followed an implicit beat. And since their proximity was close due to their tethered legs, there was limited range of movement - on had to either body the attack, dodge it with minimal movement or parry it with split-second decision-making.

Marie was completely enthralled by the heated brawl. As it grew in intensity with each passing second, she found it harder to keep track. And then it happened, an inaudible but visible groan escaped Mage Royce's lips as, for the twentieth time since the start of the fight, another jab connected with his stomach. Although Mage Maddi was the one that looked worse for the wear, while Mage Royce looked relatively untouched, she wasn't the first to break. With the sign of fatigue evident, Mage Maddi doubled down. The next punch that arrived towards her face connected with her elbow. Instead of the leathery sound of carnal collision, a sharp crack resounded - Mage Royce's fist had shattered after hitting Mage Maddi's elbow. She then wrapped her left arm around his right arm while Mage Royce recoiled from the pain, and accelerated her head forward for a headbutt. Another cracking sound as their skulls crashed. She then sent another stomach punch, then a headbutt, then another punch which transitioned into a vice-grip over Mage Royce's lower rib. With a sudden yank, the rib was fractured and a pained scream gushed out of Mage Royce... who was immediately silenced with another headbutt that broke his nose. The overload of attacks finally sent him overboard and into a state of unconsciousness.

"Victory goes to Rianna Maddi," the fight moderator declared.

Mage Maddi clicked her tongue derisively and spat the blood leaking from the bruises inside her mouth to the ground. "Weakling!"

While this world was backwards in many aspects, one thing the knowledge and technology from Guy's world couldn't hold a candle to here was the extent to which combat arts and warfare had developed. Guy was certain that if even the most heavily trained and experienced mixed martial-artist from his past life was forced to fight toe-to-toe with a cultivator of similar strength, the latter would exit victorious in nine out of ten bouts. If they were forced to fight the myriad of beasts and magical flora that were scattered accross this world, they wouldn't even stand a chance.

Combat arts in his past life had stopped developing the moment a combatant could take another's life with the pull of a trigger. From that point onwards, the arts moved in a different direction. It wasn't about killing anymore, but to subdue. It became a sport.

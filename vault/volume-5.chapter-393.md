While this world was backwards in many aspects, one thing the knowledge and technology from Guy's world couldn't hold a candle to here was the extent to which combat arts and warfare had developed. Guy was certain that if even the most heavily trained and experienced mixed martial-artist from his past life was forced to fight toe-to-toe with a cultivator of similar strength, the latter would exit victorious in nine out of ten bouts. If they were forced to fight the myriad of beasts and magical flora that were scattered accross this world, they wouldn't even stand a chance.

Combat arts in his past life had slowed in development the moment a combatant could take another's life with the pull of a trigger. From that point onwards, combat arts become more aligned with sports that what they were initially supposed to be used for, killing. One could argue that combat arts are more geared towards self-defence, but Guy could ascertain that this was only the modern interpretation. True combat arts were vehicles to deliver death swiftly and effectively. Even the most effective ones that prevailed in his past life, in the context of sports applications, were originally ones geared towards killing.

Hence, even with all the benefits offered via the Church of the True World, there was one thing Guy could do nothing about and that was to bring his Sect's Members up to this world's base standard for combat preparedness. There was a truckload of theoretical knowledge about combat in his mind, but what use was it when he couldn't apply it properly. Has anyone ever heard of someone learning how to fight by just reading a book? Combat is a collaborative and kinesthetic process.

In fact, Guy did know a decent amount of Judo - this was something he picked up from the soldiers who would often accompany him while travelling - just so that he would have a method to protect himself. He COULD teach this to the Sect Members, but what use would it be? The rules of engagement when it comes to magic are always irregular. The combat arts of this world accept that fact and are designed to keep this irregularity in mind.

Yet, just because they are most suitable to the conditions of this world doesn't make them most optimised.

"This workout plan is idiotic. You are leaving no time for recovery," Jean complained as she perused the document Rianna and Shay-Hade reluctantly submitted. Guy had placed the resposibility of monitoring the duo's escapades and discoveries on Jean, since he felt that she was most suitable to liaison on this matter being the go-to authority on health and safety of the Sect. He also figured that since Jean bore a light grudge against them, she would be more critical of the results.

"Why do you need to recover? Did you not hear what we said about the nature of the cultivation method?!" Rianna snapped back in annoyance. "It's all about pushing the body to the extreme."

"But if you don't let the muscles recover, all that effort is wasted," Jean argued. "Sufficient rest and recuperation is paramout for growth. Let me put it this way, what you're prescribing is to exert an already damaged muscle. If you just wait and let it recuperate, then you can work out an even stronger muscle to higher limits."

"It's a waste of time," Rianna responded.

"That is an opinion and not a fact," Jean pointd out. "Practise the scientific approach here. You have experience about the performance with your method, now try it with my variations and see how the response is."

Rianna growled as she considered Jean's words.

"Look, I know its hard for you to believe me, so why don't you just |Inspect| as yourself while you train? It's not like we're doing something that cannot be observed?" Jean proposed.

"Jean makes a good point," Guy complemented. "If you wish to build on your knowledge you need to be open to new and possibly opposing ideas. Do not deny it until you try it."

"Whatever," Rianna dismissed. "Shay-Hade, come! We have some work to do."

The duo then left the meeting room in an irritated huff.

Just as Guy predicted, they returned the next day with an unwilling expression drawn on their faces.

"It worked, didn't it?" Jean asked half-excitedly and half-mockingly. "You better have scaled the rest and recovery according to your physique!"

"You don't have to be so smug," Rianna grumbled.

Dora never expected to travel so far and wide across the Empire in her entire life. Her world was quite small, spanning only the limits of Twilight Village and a few kilometres into the nearby forest including Fancy's meadow. Speaking of-

"I hope Fancy is doing okay... It's disappointing that I could't take all those beautiful flowers from that flower shop in the Capital. She would have loved those amazing colour!" Dora murmured forlornly as she halted her skip and observed the array of wildflowers growing near the outskirts of Resting Town.

She used to be so envious of Kano when he went to Radiant City with Medium Sis' family. Her brother brought back so many fun stories and even more souvenirs that it made her head spin!

"I'll defeat him this time!"

She purchased twice the amount of souvenirs and visited twice the number of exotic places. In fact, she was ready to declare with adamant certainty that the Capital was in a league of its own.

"Radiant City is nothing compared to the Capital."

It was massive! It was bright! It had so many people! It had so many shops! It had everything, and more! Of course, she hadn't yet properly been to Radiant City to make a proper judgement, but she didn't care. Kano hadn't been to the Capital either, what would he know?

Dora grew giddy just thinking back to her short yet eventful time at Sunspear.

"Its unfortunate that we had to cut our trip short," she said with a disappointed sigh. There were so many more places to visit, though Father and Medium Sis didn't allow her to go. It was disappointing, but she trusted her Father in that he would never do anything that would hurt her or make her feel bad. Where did this confidence come from? Dora couldn't say, it just felt... right?

Dora wasn't old enough to question the meaning behind her emotions. Unlike Kano, who went through training as an artist and was required to be critical about his emotions and feelings, she lived a more upbeat and carefree life. She lowered herself and took deep whiff of a multicoloured flower, only to reel back with disgust.

"Pheeeew!" She evoked with a scrunched up face. "It looks so good, but smells horrible."

As she gently guided her discombobulated senses back to normalcy, she noticed something happening around her, which was that absolutely nothing was happening around her. There was complete and utter silence, which was a first for her. S

Watching paint dry. Watching grass grow. Watching mountains turn into dust as it stands the test of time. 

Jean wondered if either of those activities would be more entertaining and fruitful than what she was attempting right now?

"What am I even doing right now?" She wondered out loud.

She was currently sitting on a rock which she had manually moved from afar to a location exactly 100 metres away from the precise boundary where the plague-affected region ends. She was sitting on it, with her head resting on her palms, deep in thought. Kili sat behind the rock and was working through one of the many workbooks they had carried along with them.

"Did you say something, Big Sis?" Kili asked offhandedly while she tapped the pencil against her forehead in deep thought.

"I think I've bitten more than I can chew," Jean admitted. "What was I even thinking? That I could solve a problem that hordes of mages far more knowledgeable and powerful than I have failed?"

"Is there anything I can do?" Kili asked as she diverted her attention from her workbook.

Jean wanted to answer 'Yes!' but they did not leave her throat. She shook her head and dismissed Kili back to her work. Jean knew for a fact that Kili was the solution to this problem. The Universal Panacea Physique was the all-cure... allegedly. There was no certainty that whatever monstrosity the Plague Emperor had unleashed here could be counteracted by Kili's unique physique. And Jean had no intention of putting it to the test and sending Kili to what might be her uncertain demise.

Besides! If Jean needed Kili to solve her problems, then how could she pit herself against the Plague Emperor himself?

Of course, she ignored the fact that the gap between the Plague Emperor's realm when this plague was released and Jean's own cultivation realm was separated by a complete realm!

Jean slapped her cheeks with both her hands to redirect her focus. "Let's start from the beginning!"

The first thing Jean did was move Kili beyond the artificial ravine separating the cordoned of region. There she set up a temporary shelter in a decently elevated and hidden location, so that the little girl could continue going about her business in safety. Then, Jean returned to the cordon and started to set up her work tent. Although the Rasmus Clan had done extensive research into the Plague of Dark Cleansing, Jean realised that their approach had been wrong from the get go.

The disease was highly irregular, so it couldn't be treated like any regular disease. It affected animals, plants and even the land. Since three things are being affected, the mages who came to this region in order to excise the plague approached the problem with three prongs. One was to create a cure for infected animals (which also includes humans), another was to cure the ailing plants, and finally the third to revitalise the land. This had also been the Rasmus Clan's approach.

However, Jean hypothesised that this was probably where everyone was making a mistake. Instead of approaching the problem in parts, it had to be tackled in one fell swoop. The disease was singular, and its cure should be singular. But this was easier said than done, because it was notoriously hard to pinpoint. It kept evolving and altering itself whenever it 'felt' threatened. People thought that it was alive, which was why a large portion of documented 'cures' are basically highly potent poisons meant to flush the system. But the disease wasn't really alive - though it wasn't completely dead either as its sentience was unquestionable.

Jean approached the barren region carefully, until the edge of her mana domain was barely within it. She pulled out her wand and carefully levitated a clean plate in her hand toward the diseased region and placed it down gently. Then, with another wave, she lifted a few grains of soil from the ground and placed it atop the plate. Finally, she cast |Inspect| and drilled into the sample on the plate with utmost scrutiny. To identify the illness, she had to know how it worked, after all.

This wasn't the first time Jean tangoed with the Plague of Dark Cleansing. A good portion of her early years had been spent in trying to fight it, although she lacked the 'tools' back then. Now though, she had the tools (her cultivation) and the knowledge to boot.

"This isn't a virus as I initially hypothesised," Jean muttered. "Well, that is inconclusive still because my earlier observations were heavily leaning towards my hypothesis."

He mana senses narrowed down on blackish-green particles that floated amidst the sandy soil - this was the Plauge. She lifted a small sample of healthy soil from outside the barren region and slowly dropped into the plate. Immediately, she noticed the particles rushing towards the healthy soil and attacking the bacteria, fungi and viruses that kept the soil "alive". The particles changed forms when they attacked the bacteria, and they changed again when they attacked the fungi, and changed once again when it came to the viruses. The attack vector was never the same. The bacteria were invaded and decimated from within, the fungi fared a similar fate where their moisture was quickly drained and decayed, and the viruses were swallowed and captured altogether. Almost instantaneously, the healthy soil lost its rich brown colour and turned sandy. It was an indiscriminate slaughter at a microscopic scale. Jean felt sick just looking at it. She quickly retracted her mana senses and trudged back to her work tent.

At this moment, Jean realised that she was truly out of her league.

"I am not ready for this," she mumbled. But Jean couldn't quit. "I have to put an effort, at least."

At that moment, Jean remembered a phrase Mister Larks often told his younger students.

"When you're stuck and don't know what to do, try everything you can and know. If you throw a hundred darts at once, at least one should stick. Just take the one that sticks and try repeating it again and again until all hundred stick."

Jean revealed a reminiscent smile as she remembered the dumbfounded expression of all the children as Mister Larks actually tossed a hundred darts against a tree and all hundred stuck true.

"Wait a minute!" Jean snapped her finger. She hurriedly rushed towards her bag and pulled out a book with the title, "Evolutionary Algorithms". This was the package Marie had stuffed into Jean's hand. It was a dry read, on topics beyond her expertise and understanding. But Marie had told her to read it and understand it. Read it, Jean did. Understand it? Sort of. She'd only made it halfway through, not for the lack of trying.

Jean flipped through the text and paused at the page with the heading, "Genetic Algorithm".

In fact, this was the only chapter Jean properly understood in the entire book. This was mainly because it was said to have been derived by the theory of natural selection. Natural selection could be thought of as a nicer way to define the state of the world: "The survival of the fittest". Only the fittest can make it to the next generation.

Nucleic Acids that make up DNA and RNA is said to one of the building blocks of all life. All species share similarities in their DNA. Amongst humans, there is a 99.9% similarity in the DNA makeup. Our closest specie relative, the chimpanzee, has us sharing 98.8%. But if just 1.2% variation results in a completely different species, how much of a difference would the 0.1% mean between humans of the same specie?

Let's say a highly contagious disease, with a high mortality rate, spreads around the world. People are susceptible to it, they succumb to the disease and many die. However, the 0.1% variation finds a set of humans who have a higher tolerance to the disease and are able to resist it, overcome it, or are immune to it altogether. This set are guaranteed propagation of their DNA, as the ones who succumb to the disease are removed from the mating pool naturally. The new generation of humans have the 0.1% already included in their DNA that assures their resistance against the disease. Amongst this new generation, only those with the greatest resistance or downright immunity will have a better luck in propagating their seed. After years and multiple generations, humans are born who may have total immunity to the disease.

Jean's eyes brightened with a newfound sense of possibility. The genetic algorithm, takes this simplified explanation of the natural selection process, and applies it to a myriad of problems, with the assumption that only the most optimal solution (amongst the available solutions) will remain after the evolutionary algorithm naturally phases out the suboptimal solutions with every generation. It offered a way to tackle complex problems by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution.

With renewed determination, Jean delved into her memories and recollected the details of the chapter. The genetic algorithm involved creating a population of potential solutions, each represented by a set of parameters or characteristics. Through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm would iteratively refine these solutions, gradually converging on an optimal or near-optimal outcome.

Excitement coursed through Jean's veins as she realised the potential of applying this algorithm to her problem. She could treat the disease as an optimization challenge, seeking the best combination of factors that would counteract its devastating effects. By formulating the problem in this way, she might be able to overcome the plague's adaptability and complexity.

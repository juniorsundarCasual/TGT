Krish and Marie exited from the Raynor Family's mansion without any commotion; their detour through it made less of a ripple than a speck of dust falling upon a still water surface. 

While they walked past the entrance gate and turned the corner, Marie could barely take her eyes off of the pristine new ceramic canister in her hands, which she now knew was called a Contract Seal, and her Master. Her eyes darted periodically between the static seal in her grasps and Krish's hobbling form, and her expression started to become unreadable.

At this point Krish could easily ascertain that his precious Disciple's mind was probably working in overdrive trying to come up with outrageous theories and explanations of everything she had observed up to this point. Rather than leaving the girl to her devices, Krish decided that it was best to intervene and entertain her queries.

"What's with the face?" Krish inquired, and slowed his movement to a steady walking pace.

"This!" She immediately shot back, pushing the canister in her hands forward. "What- Why- No! Just explain this."

"Where do you want me to start?" Krish said with a weak smile, he could already predict where this was going, and right on queue-

"From the beginning!"

"It's a really long story," Krish sighed. "Narrow it down for me."

Marie grunted in distress and scratched her head in frustration. "Fine! This Contract Seal - what is it really?"

"By that do you mean, 'What is a Contract Seal?' or 'What is the purpose of this Contract Seal?' or-" Krish's word halted in their tracks as he received a pointed glare from his Disciple.

He coughed to erase his hesitation and restarted. "The Contract Seal, as its name implies, is a soul-binding contract between two entities that runs on Dwarven magic. Although the seal is verbal, it only works if the spoken and unspoken intention of the two contractees match perfectly."

"That seems kind of finicky, doesn't it? Why can't it be written?" Marie commented.

"Because Dwarves don't have a written script of any kind," Krish dropped a bombshell that nearly caused Marie's eyeballs to pop off their sockets.

"What about these, then?" Marie questioned while pointing at the intricately embedded symbols along the sides of the canister.

"Similar, but not entirely so. They don't read those symbols, they feel them, hear them, smell them... experience them," Krish explained, although it did not fully satisfy Marie's curiousity.

"Exploring Dwarven culture and tradition is another rabbit hole that I don't wish to go down at this moment-"

Marie waved her hand and shot out, "Fine! Fine! Let's get back to what you were saying before."

"Anyways, not many Contract Seals exist in circulation on Gaea, for obvious reasons. Many years past, though, these were the most prefe"

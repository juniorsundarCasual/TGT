Hearing no response, Jean started to inch closer towards the source of the hushed sounds, while keeping her mana senses extended to their limits. The sphere of mana spread outwards and immediately intercepted two figures hiding under the floorboards of the house. Jean furrowed her brows and shoved her hand into the wood and pulled it out.

A shriek overlaid on top of a deathly cough resounded, as the forms of a dishevelled girl hunched defensively over her laying mother came into view. It would have been a welcome sight, if not for the fact that the mother was covered completely in black blisters of which a few had already ruptured and gotten onto the skin and face of the girl. Jean immediately bent over and yanked the girl away from her mother.

"NO!" The girl yelled. "Let me go!"

"You will die!" Jean shot back.

*What does this remind you of?*

'Not. Now.'

"Let me go! Mom!" The little girl yelled frantically as she tried to claw herself away from Jean's grasps.

"You will get sick! Please, listen to me," Jean pleaded.

"NO! LET ME GO!" The girl cried. "MOM!"

The woman, who was visibly dehydrated and deathly pale, released a pained cough, "Kili..."

"MOM! I'm here- MOM!"

"Don't... come..." the woman groaned through heavy breath. The girl went limp in Jean's hand and started to whimper sorrowfully. The woman turned her head slightly and looked at Jean through glazed over eyes.

"Save... her..." Those were the woman's final words before her breath seized and her heart stopped.

"Mom?" The girl yelped. Jean immediately pressed her fingers against the side of the girl's neck and overloaded the motor nerve bundles altogether, knocking her out.

*You let another mother die!* The voice taunted.

#She was already on her last leg by the time we arrived. There was nothing you could do-#

*Excuses!*

Jean retreated and pressed her back against the wall, and covered her face with her palms. Her breath started to grow frantic. In her mind, the image of the deceased woman started to overlap with her mother.

*You killed me!*

*MURDERER!*

*MURDERER! MURDERER! MURDERER! KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF! KILL-*

"Young Miss!" Josie's voice cut through the malicious din polluting her thoughts.

"Josie? Y-You're alive? W-What happened?" Jean shot back successively.

"Well-"

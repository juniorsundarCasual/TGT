Jean was well-read in magic. Because she couldn't learn or practice it in her early teens, all she could do was brush up on theories to fill up the void in her heart. She had knowledge about a lot of concepts and topic ranging from trivial to the arcane. However, she could not retrieve any information regarding the so-called "Universal Panacea Physique" and why Josie called it a two-faced gift.

"Now that the slave has thought it over, it is reasonable that the Young Miss isn't informed of this physique. As this slave has already stated, it is extremely rare and isn't hereditary - it can pop up in anyone regardless of their lineage or birth conditions. Furthermore, knowledge about it is highly regulated by groups specialising in medicine and alchemy. This slave only knows bits and pieces from what the Mistress shared with her," Josie elaborated.

"What benefits does the physique offer?" Jean followed up.

"Benefits?" Josie half-scoffed. "This slave wouldn't call it as such."

The words left her mouth instinctively, but just as she was about to expound she noticed Kili perk her ears in anticipation. Josie coughed audibly and hinted at Jean to do something about the girl.

"It's okay," Jean responded with a shake of her head. "It is her body, after all. She deserved to remain in the loop."

Josie sighed and shrugged before continuing.

"The body's functions can be classified as either voluntary or involuntary. The former case pertains to processes that can be controlled actively, while the latter governs the passive functions. Interestingly, while a mage gains greater control over their bodies through advancement, their passive functions are still limited in their scope of control. You CAN force your heart to beat slower, but that requires you to assign a part of your mental capacity to achieve the result."

Josie paused so that the premise solidified in Jean's mind. She tried to keep it simple enough so that even the little girl could understand, though she could see from Kili's expression that some of it had flown over her head. Once Josie received a nod of comprehension from Jean, she continued.

"The Universal Panacea Physique removes this limiter and makes it so that the passive processes become just as, if not more, controllable as the active ones. In fact, the whole business becomes second nature - you don't even need to think or focus on it before the body starts behaving the way you want it to," Josie highlighted.

"The little girl unwaveringly believed that the 'potion' would turn her tongue green, and her body's passive physiology adapted to that belief. If I told her that the vinegar was actually sugar syrup, and the girl was convinced of that fact, then she would taste sugar syrup," Josie added.

"That's amazing! Is that why her immune system neutralised the virus? She didn't get sick because she believed that she wasn't sick? That makes no sense!" Jean evoked her incredulity. "This is completely unscientific!"

"Special physiques and bloodlines seldom follow common sense," Josie supported. "Though the Universal Panacea Physique is admittedly one that makes the least sense. You can already guess the potential in this girl's body. As long as she believes she is impervious to anything that requires a passive response from the body, she can never be affected by it. She is immune to nearly all poisons, extreme temperatures, diseases and her healing faculties are dialled beyond a hundred - and this is all just to name a few."

"How come I've never heard about anyone with a Universal Panacea Physique before? Given their potential, there should at least be one mage standing amongst the unparalleled experts with a similar physique?"

Josie revealed a pained expression as she glanced at Kili one last time.

"There is a reason why the physique is called the Universal Panacea," Josie hinted. Unfortunately, Jean wasn't quick enough on the uptake and wore a blank expression awaiting further explanation.

With a sigh, Josie elaborated, "A special physique is ingrained into the 'essence' of a person - their life-force or vitality, if you will. Certain high-level, and forbidden, branches of alchemy practise techniques that can extract this 'essence' of a person. They can then use this 'essence' as a catalyst or ingredient in a brew."

"You don't mean-"

"The Universal Panacea, as its name suggests, is a universal ingredient. It can be used in place of anything, or in conjunction with anything to achieve extraordinary potions with unimaginable or downright impossible effects, since the property of the extracted 'essence' is mouldable to fit the Alchemist's exact requirements," Josie confirmed with a dour expression. "The Young Miss hasn't heard of or seen anyone with a Universal Panacea Physique is because none live long enough to see the end of the tunnel. In nine out of ten cases, they undergo a gruesome essence extraction procedure for a bottlenecked mage to break through."

Once again, Jean found herself appalled and unable to digest revelations of such magnitude and consequence.

"They just kill them with no regard for life," Jean spat out, taking offence even at the thought of it.

"Though, Young Miss," Josie interrupted Jean's unaffected rage. "We may have to resort to something of that sort in order to tackle the problem here."

"Why would I even consider something like that?" Jean berated.

"What this girl holds inside her is the solution that will cure the epidemic. We don't have to perform the complete essence extraction. We can work with half a litre of her blood and extract the essence that combats the virus from it."

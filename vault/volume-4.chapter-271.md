Guy was assaulted by another scene like that from a warzone straight out of his past life. The brothel was burnt to a crisp, and the authorities were retrieving even crispier corpses whose flesh had melded into their bones, and whose bones were half-a-step away from crumbling into ashes. The retrieved bodies, or what remained of them, ranged in size and gender (though the latter was much harder to decipher). An acrid smell of burned flesh 

"All the entrances and exits were unlocked, why did no one run out?" Guy eavesdropped on a conversation between two constables nearby.

"Heck if I know! It's creepy, I tell ya! Eight other locations, exact same modus operandi. We have ourselves a serial arsonist in Sunspear."

"No survivors?" The first constable inquired. To that, the second man leaned closer and whispered in a barely audible voice.

"On paper, no survivors. But, all of the Beggars' Sect's... 'investments' made it out alive."

The first man visibly cringed at the connotation hidden in the accentuated 'investments' and probed, "Do you think it's them?"

"Can't be them. There were a lot of affluent individuals caught up in this arson case. There were some governmental officials from real high places - high as in close enough to whisper into the Emperor's ear level of high - that were killed in the process. Then there were also a few Sect Elders from the Four Greats... No one would be stupid enough to antagonise so many people in power!"

The second paused before highlighting a gruesome fact, "Though it is hard to make out given the state of the bodies, there's some creepy stuff... The investigators found that most, if not all, of the male bodies had their genitalia removed - castrated - while the female bodies were skinned alive. Whoever did this... they tortured them before burning them alive."

The first shuddered as a chill passed through him. "This can't be just one person, right? The attacks occured all over Sunspear. This has to be some kind of terrorist cell or an Unorthodox Sect flexing their power to make a point!"

Guy struggled to swallow his saliva as their conversation continued. When they listed the approximate death counts, his legs turned wobbly once again. He held back his anxiousness and let his feet carry him around Sunspear. He wanted to see, with his own eyes, just how much destruction he'd wraught. Guy remembered the locations of the establishments under the Beggars' Sect's umbrella from the map, he noted that the breadth of their reach was wide. He had no idea of "he" managed to get from one place to the next so quickly and inflict so much damage within such a short time span. It also didn't help that security had ramped up significantly given the nature and coordination of the attacks. One thing was for certain, the Other Guy was a criminal mastermind of another calibre. He had single-handedly overturned the Capital, and had done so without leaving a single clue. Guy wasn't delusional to think that the authorities at Sunspear would be bumbling idiots; they must have the cream of the crop in terms of forensic technologies both scientific and magical, and yet they were unable to discern the culprit has he visited each crime scene personally.

The weight on Guy's shoulder, which he had so expertly offloaded through carefully crafted rationalities, was starting to regrow at a frightening pace. So much death... So much carnage... Within a span of weeks, Guy had turned into a murderer... There was a limit to just how much the mind could stretch, self-correct and fix itself from the cracks forming on it before it broke apart completely. Guy managed to rescue himself from that fate earlier, but the burden had grown beyond what he could handle.

After finding himself a secluded alleyway, Guy collapsed against the wall and cradled his head. His eyes lost their lustre and turned dull. His lips flapped as he muttered unintelligible drivel. Guy was broken.

This was a crucial juncture for Guy. From this point, he would walk down one of two paths. He would either recover, or he wouldn't. In the latter case, his shattered mind would remain fragmented, and his psyche would devolve into maddness forever. In the former case, he would come out the other side a changed person. Would the change be for the better, or for the worse? That would depend on whom you asked.

Guy wasn't a person weak of mind. He had innoculated himself for the many atrocities the world could inflict upon the beings inhabiting it from his many ventures during his past lives.

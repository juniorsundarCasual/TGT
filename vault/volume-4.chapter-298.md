Jean never thought she would miss the din within her mindspace. With the complete absorption of all of her counterparts, her messy thoughts had grown... centred. There were no more voices in her thoughts except her own. No arguments. No urgent calls for violence against herself or those around her. No constant outpouring of praises and annoyingly uplifting, naive words of encouragement. Just... silence...

And it was depressing.

There were people around her who cared for her and wished well for her, sincerely. Mister Larks, Dora, and Kili. They all offered her emotional support. But it just wasn't... enough to fill that strange emptiness in her heart. She felt the same when she lost her mother. Made sense. Josie WAS almost like a mother to Jean, even if her attendant kept calling herself a slave.

Speaking of emotions. She never thought she would be able to experience them again. Though it was unfortunate that the first set of emotions she was forced to experience were so dour and sorrowful. But she couldn't show these emotions outwards. She still had to do her job; she still had to heal. She was already far too young that adults apprehensively trusted her medical skills. If she carried a depressed aura with her, she would further dissuade them from seeking treatment from her.

How much of her current trajectory was being affected by her solemn vow? She did not know. And frankly, she did not care. Healing others offered a fitting distraction. After her advancement, a fact she didn't even get the opportunity to properly celebrate, the process of treating illnesses such as this particular virus became markedly easier.

If her immune system could combat the disease, then her body could create the required antibodies for it. These antibodies were now being catalogued inside Jean's core rather than her lymphatic system. Jean's mana could now take on the property of the antibody already catalogued in her core and could be freely controlled and channeled to where she needed it to be. Through artificial stimulation, she could then train the immune system of the recipient (as long as they were willing) to adapt the antibody for its own purposes. This ability formed through the incompatible mixture of Kili's Universal Panacea Physique and the Rat King's disease-centric cultivation.

On a side-note, this came as a blessing in disguise. Jean could now go about curing this sequestered region without exposing Kili's existence to the world. Unless people really bothered to dig deeper into the events regarding the mortal folk's treatment, which Jean suspected wouldn't be the case, they wouldn't know that in fact, the first few patients cured were through her new little nurse's blood. But no, all the Empire really cared about was the fact that a beast with powers eerily similar to the Plague Emperor spawned within the sacred grounds of the Solar Empire! Jean had heard news of a large-scale inquiry on this matter in the works, but no one bearing the Crown's orders had stepped foot in the area for days. It was all a smokescreen - a ruse. After all, the Empire needed someone to take the blame to distract the peasantfolk. The Plague Emperor was just the right type of convenient boogeyman they needed to take the fall for their callous disregard for human life. And the peasant folk? Well, what could they do even if they knew that they were being manipulated?

At the end of the day, the problem was nipped in the bud. It was barely a beast at the threshold of Core Formation realm, and the only true loss was a squadron of trained soldiers conscripted with the Galen Duchy, and maybe a year's worth of revenue through trade in this region. To truly register as a threat for the Empire, the beast had to atleast be in the Core Condensation Realm and threaten to dismantle a seat of power. Or, the loss should include the life of a scion from a storeyed clan or sect.

It was all so bleak. Jean was disgusted and enraged. But what could she do? Threaten to dismantle an institution that has lasted for at least half a milennium?

After all, her oaths did say: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure."

If she could dethrone the Sol Clan and implement a far more humane administration, it would all become better. A dangerous thought. One that Jean was quick to dismiss.

"At what cost?"

Her oaths began with: "I will first do no harm."

To gain power, something must be lost. Jean did gain power. The power to heal. What did she lose? The power to fight for those that needed her. Did she regret it?

She didn't disparage Mister Larks for what he had done for her. The gift - the oath - had saved her. The alternative would have been much worse, and many more would have suffered for it. To be essentially de-clawed and incapable of taking a life had ensured that Jean wouldn't walk down a path she would later regret. All the sincere smiles, the warm welcome, the uplifting atmosphere that came with helping people was reward enough. Besides, fighting didn't necessarily mean picking up arms and storming a castle with an army.

Jean leaned over and looked into the well before her. She had returned to the very first town she visited with Josie upon entering the quarantine. The burnt bodies had been removed. No rats either. The villagers were slowly returning to their homes, though there was a melancholy air about it. A lot of relatives, neighbours, friends and family were lost due to the disease. There were a lot of bitter memories here. A lot of horrific images deeply ingrained into the minds of these folk too.

The was trauma ingrained within these folk. However, she couldn't heal the mind, not yet at least. Besides, she had only just herself healed through a harrowing psychological experience, who was she to attempt and heal these people?

What she could do, was ensuring that their lives hereafter would be devoid of sickness. Mortal folk suffered through an assortment of illnesses in their lifetimes - they lack the hardy immunity of mages after all. Most, if not all, of these diseases could be treated. But as it was said: "prevention is preferable to cure".

Jean retrieved

The disease is being cured rapidly. Her ability is similar to how a virus works. By infecting herself with the illness, she just needs to get cured herself by her own immune system and she is able to produce a virus that acts like an antiviral. She distributes this virus into the watersupplies and food and feeds the people in the camp. The tactic would be abhorrent if she were a bioterrorist, but her Oath prevents her from taking a life.

Goran arrives as a patient leaves the tent. He approaches his smiling daughter and pulls her into a tight hug. Slowly, the girl deflates and descends into a full-blow wail filled with pain.

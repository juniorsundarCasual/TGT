Jean continues to cure people, but this time she has Kili assisting her. She is putting up a brave front, wearing a smile on her face. Her first expressions are fakes.

The disease is being cured rapidly. Her ability is similar to how a virus works. By infecting herself with the illness, she just needs to get cured herself by her own immune system and she is able to produce a virus that acts like an antiviral. She distributes this virus into the watersupplies and food and feeds the people in the camp. The tactic would be abhorrent if she were a bioterrorist, but her Oath prevents her from taking a life.

Goran arrives as a patient leaves the tent. He approaches his smiling daughter and pulls her into a tight hug. Slowly, the girl deflates and descends into a full-blow wail filled with pain.

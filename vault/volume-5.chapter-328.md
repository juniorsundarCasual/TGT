Jean began her journey directionless. From Twilight Village, she travelled towards Wayward Town, and hitch-hiked with a caravan heading southwards. Merchants were more than willing to take her along after she proved her worthiness by treating a few members of trivial illnesses and injuries such as the caravan leader with his pollen allergy, and all the drivers with their lower back injuries and one in particular with a slipped disk.

Even a few of the hired escorts, who were from another Sect, received treatments from Jean, which led her to being treated like a queen throughout the entire journey. After all, who doesn't want a healer on their side. In fact, her presence improved the speed of the journey substantially, since the escorts didn't have to navigate and plan around confrontation and approach fights with less caution (even though Jean emphasised that they not do that).

"Please take this as a token of our gratitude," the caravan leader said as he stuffed a pouch of coins into Jean's hands.

"I can't do that. I told you that all I need is a ride. My assistance and contribution was payment for the service you have offered me," Jean responded while nudging the pouch back towards the leader.

"You don't understand. Your work while the caravan was moving has more than paid for your ride. This is from our side. You didn't have to help cure Myran of his lower back injury - the slipped disk as you call it. Nor did you have to excise the cyst in Belize's wife's uterus while we were stopped at his village. This is a token of our gratitude. It may not be much, but it is what everyone here has cobbled together. Please accept it," the leader insisted while shoving it back into Jean's hand.

"I have decided, I will take you on as my woman!" One of the mages in the escort declared as he took a decisive forward towards Jean. He was a lean young man with sharp features. His nose was pointing towards the sky, as he spoke.

At that moment, a resounding slap struck the mage from behind. "Is this how you thank the person who reattached your sword-arm?"

It was a gruffer voice, belonging to a middle-aged man who also wore the same faint-crimson coat as the lean youth, with the insignia of their sect - a flaming sword splitting a mountain in half - emblazoned on their chests. His long and silvering hair was tied into a thick pony-tail that reached his lowerback.

"Don't you see, I am doing this for her!" The youth said with an accusatory hiss, as he nursed his aching head. "If she marries me, she will get a fast track into the Infernal Sword Sect! Then she can enjoy the same benefits as me, a true Inner Disciple! She can then spend her time in safety and research all that she desires instead of going on such a dangerous journey just to gain some insight!"

The boy's eyes sparkled as he narrated his idea. But suddenly, she body shivered.

"E-Elder Soam," the youth stuttered as he felt the weight of the Elder's accusatory gaze. "I just wanted to help Mage Rasmus. Can't you see how destitute her sect is? The only weapon on armour the sect can afford to give its touring members is a wooden stick with an enchantment gem stuck on it!"

As the boy said that, the Elder's gaze lowered and caught the exquisite enchanted sword strapped to the boy's waist. His eyes then shot over to the girl's side and noticed the wooden stick with the mana gem on it.

"*cough* That stick has its own uses. It doesn't fall short against our sword in any way," Elder Soam said, though his uncertain voice gave away that those were just conciliatory words.

Jean simply smiled and said, "I know that Mage Rig had no ill intentions when he... proposed to me just now."

The youth's face turned a vibrant crimson shade, through he maintained a facade of haughty aloofness.

"But I'm content where I am," Jean explained.

"You can have so much more!" Mage Rig beckoned. "You will have a lot more resources at your disposal in the Infernal Sword Sect. We may not as old as the Four Greats, but our history isn't any less storied."

"It isn't a matter of resources," Jean responded with an understanding nod. "It's about everything else. I can have all the resources I need in the world, yet still stall in my cultivation. I don't think the Infernal Sword Sect can offer what I require to advance my cultivation."

The youth wanted to counter Jean's argument but a firm hand on her shoulder held him back. Turning around, he noticed that it was Elder Soam.

"Regardless, we are truly in your debt, Mage Rasmus. We of the Infernal Sword Sect stick to a strict code of chivalry. And as an Elder of the Sect, I must set an example. For your contributions to our campaign, for going beyond what is required of you, please accept this token of our gratitude."

With that said, the Elder extended a pouch and placed it on Jean's hand. Jean peeked inside and was shocked to find it filled with Mana Crystals.

"This is too much!"

The Infernal Sword Sect members were having none of it and simply leapt away, leaving Jean alone with Kili. After a moment of silence, Jean released a hearty chuckled and stored her bounty inside her bag.

"Do not get used to this," Jean explained. "The world isn't always this nice. Doing good for others doesn't guarantee that you will receive good in return. Newton's third law doesn't apply to humans, unfortunately."

"So why do we still do good?" Kili asked while scratching her head.

"We do it for ourselves," Jean answered. She tightened her bag and started to walk onwards while continuing, "No one is truly selfless, and those that are selfless are equivalent to myths - that's just how rare they are. Even I cannot claim that I am completely selfless. I help others because it brings me closer to my goal."

"What goal?" Kili asked as she skipped to match Jean's pace.

"I want to end the Plague Emperor's reign," Jean declared with steel in her voice. "I don't want to kill him, but put an end to everything his cultivation stands for."

"But why?"

"It is hard to classify things as black or white in this world - that is to say nothing is wholly good and nothing is wholly bad," Jean started. "Something good can be hurtful to another, and the same can be said for the opposite. But, I can say with complete certainty that the Plague Emperor is a bad man. But it isn't all his fault - it's just that he's broken. A broken child, with no one to help them, grows to become a broken man. And a broken man sees the world around him as broken and beyond fixing. This would have been my future if not for all those that care for me."

Noticing that Kili understood her words, Jean added, "But that doesn't mean that we can forgive him for all he's done to hurt others. Actions have consequences, and his lashing out has ended up harming a lot of people. And if left alone, he will continue to harm other people. Which is why I must put an end to it."

Kili's movement slowed down as a thoughtful frown warped her expressions, "Did the Plague Emperor hurt you too, Big Sis?"

"He did. He... killed my mother," Jean answered.

"So it's revenge," Kili growled in anger.

"Not really," Jean said with a shrug. "I haven't forgiven him, but that doesn't mean I'm going to restructure my entire life just to end him."

"Isn't that what you just said before?" Kili voiced her confusion.

"Not completely. If all I cared about was to end the Plague Emperor, I wouldn't be teaching all these things to you," Jean reasoned. "Besides, its not just him that I am fighting against, it is everything his cultivation stands for."

Kili hummed affirmatively as she followed Jean along. The trek was silent, until they eventually sighted the guard tower of the town they were headed for. After clearing the first security inspection, they walked towards the gates to the town.

"How do you know if you are getting close to your goal?" Kili asked as Jean hoisted her bags after having them searched by the gate guards.

"What do you mean?"

"How can you know if you're ready to face the Plague Emperor?" Kili reiterated after taking a minute to think over her question. "Sect Leader Larks always says that 'for every goal, there needs to be measurable goals'. How will you measure if you're getting closer to your goal?"

That surprisingly insightful question stunned Jean, not just because who had asked her, but also because she did not have an answer ready for it.

"That's... a good question..." Jean commended, and received a rare beaming smile from Kili, who bounced ahead and visited a stand selling fried potatoes cut into swirls.

The question did not leave Jean's mind from that point onwards. Her work didn't falter, nor did her pursuit to gain insights. But she noticed that her gains were incremental at best - comparable to a percentage of a percentage.

One day, around a month after the start of her journey, Jean realised something while she was helping treat a necrotised limb for a farmer in some rural village. She realised that, knowingly or unknowingly, her cultivation had become the antithesis of the Plague Emperor's. His pursuit to cover the world in a plague so vile that none could survive, was something Jean sought to remedy.

If that is assumed as true, then the only way to gauge her progress towards her goal would be to directly pit herself against something the Plague Emperor unleashed into this world while he was still growing into the crown.

Once this thought sprouted in Jean's head, her feet moved subconsciously. Her every decision from that point onwards, knowingly or unknowingly, drew her in a particular direction.

Unfortunately, Jean's journey would now take her to a place where she would have to relive her childhood trauma.

And now, as she stood on a land where none could survive, which lay barren for as far as the eye could see, she released a heavy breath through quivering lips as she looked ahead, at a conspicuous and unnatural pit. 

"I'm back, mother," she whispered, her voice echoing ominously all over the tainted lands bathed in one of the vilest plagues the Plague Emperor had ever birthed - the Plague of Dark Cleansing.

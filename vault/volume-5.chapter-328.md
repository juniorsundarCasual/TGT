Jean began her journey directionless. From Twilight Village, she travelled towards Wayward Town, and hitch-hiked with a caravan heading southwards. Merchants were more than willing to take her along after she proved her worthiness by treating a few members of trivial illnesses and injuries such as the caravan leader with his pollen allergy, and all the drivers with their lower back injuries and one in particular with a slipped disk.

Even a few of the hired escorts, who were from another Sect, received treatments from Jean, which led her to being treated like a queen throughout the entire journey. After all, who doesn't want a healer on their side. In fact, her presence improved the speed of the journey substantially, since the escorts didn't have to navigate and plan around confrontation and approach fights with less caution (even though Jean emphasised that they not do that).

"Please take this as a token of our gratitude," the caravan leader said as he stuffed a pouch of coins into Jean's hands.

"I can't do that. I told you that all I need is a ride. My assistance and contribution was payment for the service you have offered me," Jean responded while nudging the pouch back towards the leader.

"You don't understand. Your work while the caravan was moving has more than paid for your ride. This is from our side. You didn't have to help cure Myran of his lower back injury - the slipped disk as you call it. Nor did you have to excise the cyst in Belize's wife's uterus while we were stopped at his village. This is a token of our gratitude. It may not be much, but it is what everyone here has cobbled together. Please accept it," the leader insisted while shoving it back into Jean's hand.

"I have decided, I will take you on as my woman!" One of the mages in the escort declared as he took a decisive forward towards Jean. He was a lean young man with sharp features. His nose was pointing towards the sky, as he spoke.

At that moment, a resounding slap struck the mage from behind. "Is this how you thank the person who sowed back your sword-arm?"

It was a gruffer voice, belonging to a middle-aged man who also wore the same faint-crimson coat as the lean youth, with the insignia of their sect - a flaming sword splitting a mountain in half - emblazoned on their chests. His long and silvering hair was tied into a thick pony-tail that reached his lowerback.

"Don't you see, I am doing this for her!" The youth said with an accusatory hiss, as he nursed his aching head. "If she marries me, she will get a fast track into the Infernal Sword Sect! Then she can enjoy the same benefits as me, a true Inner Disciple! She can then spend her time in safety and research all that she desires instead of going on such a dangerous journey just to gain some insight!"

The boy's eyes sparkled as he narrated his idea. But suddenly, she body shivered.

"E-Elder Soam," the youth stuttered as he felt the weight of the Elder's accusatory gaze. "I just wanted to help Mage Rasmus. Can't you see how destitute her sect is? The only weapon on armour the sect can afford to give its touring members is a wooden stick with an enchantment gem stuck on it!"

As the boy said that, the Elder's gaze lowered and caught the exquisite

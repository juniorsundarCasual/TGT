Her entire life, Shuri spent every waking second in a treacherous swamp where danger lurked behind every corner. Her life was quite literally teetering precariously at the edge of a sharpened blade. Through repeated failures and stumbles, Shuri's instincts became extremely sensitive to encroaching danger.

Ever since she hitchhiked with the man whose name she deigned not to learn, her instincts were blaring "DANGER" ceaselessly. However, Shuri suppressed it and wrote it off as uneasiness wrought by the sudden change in scenery. After all, moving from an environment where one needs to be constantly on the lookout for death-inducing trouble, to another where a mistake didn't always end up with death or serious maiming can be seriously disorienting. Thus, Shuri affiliated the growing sense of foreboding gnawing at her as the result of an idle mind cooking up all kinds of trouble.

She couldn't have been more wrong! Shuri cursed herself for doubting her highly attuned instincts, because danger came knocking and brought with it a side of death.

It started with a faintly audible whooshing noise that was followed by the loud and troubled neighs of horses. More of those whooshing noises followed, Shuri recognised them as the sounds of arrows cutting through the air. The carriage lurched forward as the horses dashed to save their hides.

Even with the threat looming over the horizon, Shuri's mind stayed as unperturbed as a still pond. She knew she couldn't run away at this point, the only option was to wait it out and prepare for the worst case scenario. Shuri quickly popped open the nearest barrel and started to toss out the clothes packed within. The container was just large enough to hold a person of her size, which she took advantage of. Right as the barrel's lid fastened onto the container, Shuri heard an approaching arrow through the gap. The gruesome sound of metal tearing through flesh sounded with a muffle, and was immediately followed by the chilling sound of a person drowning in their own blood. The driver had succumbed to the ambush.

And then the world turned upside down and sideways. Shuri barely held herself together before a sudden change in acceleration cause her head to crash violently against the side of the container she was hiding inside. Then darkness took her.

In this darkness, Shuri was forced to relive another vivid excerpt from her not-so-fabulous life. Was it Shuri's subconscious guilt that selected this particular memory from all others still occupying real-estate in her sticky mind - the guilt of not supporting the only person in the Palace that was on her side unconditionally? Unlikely, because she did not feel any remorse over how the events panned out. The maid girl's support, though emotionally fulfilling, was akin to a tumour that could metastasise at any instance. She would have invited more trouble that what she was worth, so Shuri deemed it better to nip the problem in the bud.

Needless to say, the maid did not survive the impromptu surgical procedure of separating her tongue from her body. Tragic. But not regretful.

At least it wasn't another memory with her late mother. The effect of those lingered well past the point Shuri would gain consciousness. It could mean that maybe Shuri could exit the inevitable confrontation against the ambushers with minimal harm - a false sense of hope. There was only certain death on the other side, to think otherwise would be futile. But Shuri wasn't going to succumb to the sweet embrace of death without a fight.

As she regained consciousness, she was subjected to another disorienting bout of movement before her container shattered and revealed her to the world, and to her attackers.

They were seven men. Each sporting similarly unkempt and overgrown facial hair that was knotted and caked with dirt. They each had a weapon in hand; two carried bows and the rest carried haphazardly forged weapons with rust forming on its surface and its edges deformed through wear and tear. Their eyes carried

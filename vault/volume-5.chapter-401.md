Jean knocked on the door to Shuri's room and awaited permission to enter. Minutes passed and no indication arrived from beyond the door. She then pulled her lips in bit down worriedly. She knocked again and warned, "I'm coming in."

Once inside, she noticed that Shuri was curled up in her bed. The breakfast brought in earlier in the morning remained by her bedside, untouched. A depressing aura hung over the girl, one which even bordered on suicidal tendencies. This, Jean was intimately familiar with. Jean's mana senses scoured the room for anything that could encourage the girl to take drastic measures. Her focus was on sharp objects, anything that could be used as a rope, and anything that could suffocate or choke.

"You have to eat," Jean said while maintaining her scan. "How will you have energy to do anything if you plan to starve yourself to death?"

"What's the point," Shuri mumbled from under her blanket. "I can't advance. If I can't advance, I will remain stuck like... this. Heck, I can't even use magic without my entire body convulsing in pain."

"What about all the progress you've made till now. Are you prepared to just give it all up?" Jean probed.

"Get up!" Marie snapped. "Eat!"

"Why are you here? I told you to leave!" Shuri yelled back. "Just let me be, please!"

"No can do," Marie denied while placing the plate full of food in her hand on Shuri's lap. "You either eat this, or I will call in Matron Reva."

"Is that a threat?"

"I think it was pretty clear that it was a threat," Marie responded with a faint smirk.

Shuri looked at the food on her lap for a while. "I don't feel like eating."

"Then don't eat to feel, eat to live."

"I'm a Foundation Establishment realm mage, I can go for days without food or water," Shuri reasoned.

"But the energy to sustain those foodless days will be drawn from your mana core, which you absolutely can't let happen unless you wish to suffer excruciating pain," Marie rebutted.

"So what?" Shuri declared. "Why does it even matter?"

"Let it all just "

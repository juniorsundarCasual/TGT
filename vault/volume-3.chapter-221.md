"Looks magnificent, don't it?" [Guy]

"Psht! It's extravagant," [Grace]

"It's necessary." [Guy]

"... I know. It's... good." [Grace]

"I like it," [Markus]

"I like the playground in the Community Centre," [Kano]

"Me too! Me too!" [Dora]

"I appreciate the upgrades to the garden," [Jean]

"I'd like to share in that appreciation." [Grace]

"It is adequate. I have seen better," [Josie]

"Josie!" [Jean]

"It's alright, Jean. I appreciate the honesty. I'm open to feedback and suggestions, please let me know if there is anything I can do," [Guy]

"Young Miss will be a part of this Sect, of course it will be this slave's responsibility to elevate its quality." [Josie]


"What now?" [Markus]

"Well, we will be travelling to the Capital of the Solar Empire for the Solar Sect Alliance Conference to officially register our Sect and recruit a few members. We need at least fifteen members in the Sect including the Sect's Leader and Elders for it to be recognised as functioning. To qualify as an official member, the individual must be older than twelve years of age, so we cannot include Dora and Kano. Grace cannot cultivate, so although she is a part of the Sect she is recognised as an Auxiliary member. This means that including Marie and Mage Nara, there are only five people in our Sect at the moment. Unfortunately for us, there will only be three members joining us from the Village - not all parents want their child to grow up to be a mage which is admittedly a dangerous path to take. This means that we will be short of seven members. Although we can register under the Alliance, our state will be in limbo until we meet this requirement." [Guy]

"So many rules and regulations!" [Grace]

"I can understand their point of view in this matter. Without all of these regulations in place, just about anyone can start a Sect. In doing so, it would attract conflict as Sects fought against each other for superiority. It would be a bloodbath. So, although some of the rules may seem excessive and others equally as pretentious, but they are necessary... for the time being anyways." [Guy]

"What's the travel itenerary, Master?"

"You, Jean and I will be travelling along with a Dune Caravan Management convoy to the capital. We will be functioning as the escorts, along with their own retinue and hired hands of course. For the record, treat this mission with utmost importance since there will be a few of Verum Trading Company's products included in the convoy," [Guy]

"I'm coming as well!" [Dora]

"Dora-" [Grace]

"Kano went to the city last time. You promised you'd take me there as well, but when the time came Mister Larks didn't fulfil that promise!" [Dora] "This time, I am coming along too! Oh, and Kano cannot come!"

"Why can't Kano come?" [Guy]

"Because he already went once. We need to be fair in this matter," [Dora]

""We... Let's discuss this with Matron Reva, okay?" [Guy]

"No! I'm going! I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!" [Dora]

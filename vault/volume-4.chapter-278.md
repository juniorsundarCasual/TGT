Jean's destination carried her to the Northwest of the Solar Empire. The close she approached the hotspot of the epidemic, the more she learned about it through word of mouth. With each new bite of information added to the growing list of symptoms, the deeper Jean's frown grew.

"Josie. Does this sound familiar?" She said while nudging a stack of papers towards the older woman. "Read the symptoms carefully. Pay careful attention to the nature of their deaths. What do you see?"

The duo were currently located in a resting inn along their paths - Jean and Josie shared one room while Sect Leader Guy and Dora shared the other. At this time, Jean decided to regroup and devise an action plan to tackle the illness most efficiently when she intercepted it in teh future.

Josie's brows grew furrowed as her pupils danced back-and-forth across the page. "This slave strongly urges the Young Miss fron drawing hasty conclusions. It could very well be a coincidence."

Jean slammed her hand forcefully over the table before her and slowly curled her fingers into a tight and shaking fist. "There are no coincidences. *INSERT SYMPTOMS THAT MATCH*"

"The Plague of Dark Cleansing affected mages, and mages alone," Josie interjected while pointing out a key fact.

"And whatever this is," Jean argued while tapping her index over stack of papers aggressively, "only affects common folk (as far as we know). Who knows what the disease is truly capable of?"

"Which is why we mustn't jump to conclusions," Josie reasoned. "The Young Miss is acting uncharacteristically impulsive these days."

The words were caught in Jean's throat. 'Was I?' she thought to herself. Most of her life, she'd lived in a world of black, white and grey, metaphorically. Everything was bland and lukewarm, there was no vibrancy, no joy, no dullness, no sorrow. It was hard to get used to the silence in the world around her, but the two voices in her head definitely helped distract her from it. If she really was showing emotions such as anger and irritation, it could only mean that somehow, her capacity to feel was slowly making a comeback!

"A healer cannot afford to be impatient," Josie reminded. "Impatience leads to negligence, and negligence always leads to the loss of life."

"I know. You're right," Jean relented. "But the similarities are uncanny. It just... I'm getting this... intuition? Right! I'm getting this intuition that the two are related. This new disease is like a toned down version of the Plague of Dark Cleansing."

"This slave understands where the Young Miss is coming from, but - to quote Sect Leader Larks - 'starting an investigation with a predetermined conclusion isn't an investigation, it is a verification'," Josie emphasised.

Jean nodded affirmatively and outwardly showed acceptance. However, inside, while the voices quarrelled amongst themselves, something weird worked its way down her neural channels. Jean determined this 'something weird' to be the intuition gnawing away at her. To others, this 'something weird' would be referred to by a much more mundane name - a gut feeling.

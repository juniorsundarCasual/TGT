Jean's destination carried her to the Northwest of the Solar Empire. The close she approached the hotspot of the epidemic, the more she learned about it through word of mouth. With each new bite of information added to the growing list of symptoms, the deeper Jean's frown grew.

"Josie. Does this sound familiar?" She said while nudging a stack of papers towards the older woman. "Read the symptoms carefully. Pay careful attention to the nature of their deaths. What do you see?"

The duo were currently located in a resting inn along their paths - Jean and Josie shared one room while Sect Leader Guy and Dora shared the other. At this time, Jean decided to regroup and devise an action plan to tackle the illness most efficiently when she intercepted it in teh future.

Josie's brows grew furrowed as her pupils danced back-and-forth across the page. "This slave strongly urges the Young Miss fron drawing hasty conclusions. It could very well be a coincidence."

Jean slammed her hand forcefully over the table before her and slowly curled her fingers into a tight and shaking fist. "There are no coincidences-"

"The Plague of Dark Cleansing affected mages, and mages alone," Josie interjected while pointing out a key fact.

"And whatever this is," Jean argued while tapping her index over stack of papers aggressively, "only affects common folk (as far as we know). Who knows what the disease is truly capable of?"

"Which is why we mustn't jump to conclusions," Josie reasoned. "The Young Miss is acting uncharacteristically impulsive these days."

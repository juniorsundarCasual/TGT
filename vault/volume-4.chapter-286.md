A loss is always a sobering experience, especially when it's the first loss one faces in their life. Of course that is only if the party experiencing the loss is graceful enough to accept it and move on. The Rat King was not. He had never faced such an insulting loss in his entire life (in rat years)! He wasn't reconciled of it. He had essentially sacrificed over 98% of his physical growth to save himself from that demon parading in a weak skin suit. How was he supposed to know that it was all a trap, and that a great power lay hidden within that smooth, pink, hairless hide over meat and bone? The loss wasn't his fault, it was all that thing's fault, and for that, he would have his revenge!

He managed to escape that thing's dogged pursuit with great difficulty. He went through abandoned burrows and weaved past hordes of his kind to confuse the pursuer until, at last, he succeeded. It had been an entire day, and he didn't catch a whiff of that thrice damned creature out for his blood. He hearkened back to his early years, when he scavenged, skittered and skulked around in fear of the predators out to get him and his kind. It made him feel sick! He was the Rat King, damn it!

Finally, the Rat King found some reprieve from the chase. He slowed down and rested under the shade of a large tree (in rat size). After letting his heated mind halt, he was prepared to analyse his failure more carefully. It was time to regroup and come up with a counter strategy. He was done running away - that much he'd written into his bones a long time back (in rat years) after he managed to learn to control the heat coursing through his body. He recollected that the reason he managed to supercede all of his opponents was because he could benchmark them against his own kind. He defeated those slithering worms by understanding how they attacked and behaved when facing his kind. The same analysis method was used in finding out how to defeat the flying banshees with beaks. Unfortunately, there was noone to benchmark against when facing that pink-skinned creature - the gulf between himself and his kind had widened so greatly that it was impossible to do so. Nonetheless, the sacrifice of his body mass had netted him definite insight and an alternative perspective towards the mantra governing his life.

Maybe assimilate didn't necessarily mean to do it with his own kind? Maybe assimilate meant to become one with the strongest and blend in seamlessly. Growing didn't necessarily mean to physically grow, it may just mean to condense his strength - after all a creature much smaller than him had defeated him so effortlessly. And propagate- well... that probably didn't need changing.

As the Rat King pondered on this new epiphany, a loud screech following by a heavy gust of wind approached him, and then he suddenly found himself caught in a vice grip rising higher and higher.

'Damn flying banshees with beaks!' The Rat King cursed. If only he had his old body, he could waste this creature with a flick of his appendage. No matter, he hadn't forgotten his roots. Through pure instinct, he started to release the rancid black gas from his pores that completely enveloped the creature. The reaction was immediate as its screech grew huskier, and it started to lose altitude. The Rat King twisted and bit down on the creature's talons, releasing himself from its grasps. He was free, albeit high up in the air.

Rats are resilient creatures. They are expert swimmers and climbers and, in rare cases, gliders. He stretched his loose skin outwards and slowed down his speed of descent. As he did, he swerved his head around looking for an optimal place to land.

At that instant, his sight caught something interesting. It was another one of those pink-skinned creatures, though this one looked different. It lacked an appendage the other one had, and its front was rather flat too. It looked weaker, but that was perfectly fine. The reason why his earlier hunts had been successful was because his opponents treated him as a weak rat. The moment he outwardly portrayed his strength, he lost. Moral of the story? Act weaker to surprise foes into lowering their guards.

The Rat King was prepared to put his plan into motion. He would assimilate with this creature... yet how? He had an inkling of the process when it came to his own kind, since he had a thorough understanding of their anatomies. But these pink-skinned creatures were completely different. Amongst the differences, they walked on two legs and lacked a tail. Their paws looked weird too!

'I need to understand these creatures better,' the Rat King concluded. Luckily, this one in particular made it easier - it's mouth was wide open and just waiting for the Rat King to grace it with his presence. With a seamless swoop, the Rat King compressed his body and slid through the agape mouth of his potentially new vessel.

The passage way was tight. But rats specialised in navigating through tight spaces. It took some adjustment but he made it past the maw. Next came an even narrower fleshy tunnel that kept undulating, compressing and squeezing periodically. He burrowed forward, expanding the path to allow his body to move through. Blood started to ooze out the new expansions making it difficult to navigate midway, but rats were excellent swimmers. He could smell a strong acidic smell emanating from before him, which he recognised to be the stomach. The Rat King bypassed that altogether and kept burrowing deeper and deeper, and deeper.

'Assimilate... Assimilate... Assimilate...' he kept repeating, as he searched for a way to become one with this human. His

Klow gagged violently. Something disgusting was scuttling down his throat, scratching at his flesh and ripping his aesophagus with wild abandon.

"How much longer?" Kili groaned loudly, as she lay on her back and waved her legs in the air.

"I told you, there's still some work left for us to do," Jean responded with an amused smile.

"But you said that we were returning home! I need to get back before Shuri gets stronger, and I can't defeat her any more," Kili argued.

Jean waved her hand dismissively and reminded, "I don't think you should be using your powers before we know what exactly is happening to you. Learning through experimentation is all well and good as long as it isn't your body that you are messing around with."

Kili released another loud groan before rolling over and shoving her face into her pillow.

"Physician Rasmus! Physician Rasmus!" A frantic voice called out, which was immediately followed by rapid knocking on her door. Jean stood up from behind her desk and moved towards the exit briskly.

As she opened the door, she was greeted by the tear-stained face of an elderly man, hunched over and garbed in dirt-ridden clothing. A relieved expression flashed past his face before it was once again drowned in despair.

"Oh, thank goodness you are still here!" The man exclaimed amidst heavy breaths... "Physician Rasmus... My grandchild-"

Jean interrupted the struggling man with a raised palm and said, "Lead me to her."

She then turned to Kili and gestured for the girl to follow along.

The man nodded before hobbling back the way he came and down the steps. Together, they left the inn's premises and walked northwards.

After cleaning up the Plagued Lands, Jean intended to return to the Sect for some rest and recuperation. It was an arduous affair that had drained her. However, along they way, she stopped by a village where she observed and was involved in a rather peculiar event - the birth of conjoined twins.

Jean had only ever heard of such successful births through rumours in the medical circles, because it almost always resulted in the death of the foetus, or the mother. Luckily for the women going through childbirth, Jean was present and was knowledgeable about the Caesarean section, thanks to which they were able to overcome the dangers of naturally birthing the conjoined twins.

Of course, the challenge did not end after childbirth, since something had to be done about the twins who were born with a defect. The villagers were quick to dismiss the deformed twins, who were joined in the head, as they didn't believe the two could survive (which would be the case since there was no medical procedure to safely separate them). The mother, though, wasn't onboard with this dismissal and was adamant to see her children grow up to be fully functioning and independent adults.

At this juncture, Jean decided to step in. And although she didn't make any promises of success, she assured the mother that she would try her best.

She then explored the physique of the conjoined twins with great detail. She observed their neural, circulatory and skeletal systems in particular, to see how the conjoining affected them. After all, separating the two wouldn't be as simple as just cutting them at the point of intersection.

And true to her assumption, she was greeted with the sight of a supper-massive brain spanning the volume of both their skulls. The two shared a large brain.

Jean then spent three entire days, focussed completely on tracing out neural and circulatory pathways to surgically separate the twins. It was tiring and highly involved. Ultimately, the twins were separated.

Unfortunately, her attempt was only a half-success since one of the twins could not be saved. Jean was dismayed by the outcome, but the mother was overjoyed - which was understandable. She was expecting the loss of two children, but one survived. In a world where the success of childbirth grows more capricious as the number of children being born at once increases, having a success rate of 2 out of 3 was unbelievably generous.

In fact, the completion of the procedure also pushed Jean into the Internal stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. But Jean did not feel the mood to celebrate, as she was more preoccupied with burying the forgotten body of the expended twin.

This was Jean's second loss after advancing (the first being Josie), and it was another notch in her heart. After working through the sorrow, Jean resolved to cancel her return and continue her initial objective of travelling around and plying her medical craft.

She declared internally that if she were to come across another case of conjoined twins, she would ensure that both would survive. To do that, though, she needed practise, which could only be accrued through her journey - much to Kili's chagrin.

And like that, Jean turned away from her current trajectory and went to the next settlement, and then the next, and so on. With each settlement visited, Jean gained the opportunity to work with illnesses and afflictions both known and unknown. This in turn expanded her repertoire of knowledge.

Her journey ultimately landed her in the current settlement, which was a village close to becoming a township, a few hundred kilometres southwards from the Capital.

"You can explain what happened to her as we go to the location," Jean pointed out, to which the old man nodded frantically and explained.

"The child, she was playing on the tree near "

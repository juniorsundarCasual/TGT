Guy quickly found himself amidst a rather heated interrogation once the dust settled in the decimated meadow. No one knew what had to be done to rbring the lost kids back, because no one knew where the kids disappeared off to in the first place. It was only after Shuri returned three-quarters of an hour later (alone) that the search was placed on a temporary hold.

Apparently, even Marie did not know where they were, since it seemed as though the aftermath of the world collision had caused the usually unbending waves of fate to suddenly become entangled - "an indecipherable mess", were her exact words. Though Marie did affirm that whatever Mage Nara did, which resulted in his gruesome demise, had secured the safety of Dora and Kano till their return. It was a awe-inspiring realisation that one man who was at the veritable peak of power sacrificed everything for two little children. It brought on a whole new level of admiration for the now deceased man. Though Guy barely had the opportunity to dwell on it, because the moment Grace heard the confirmation of her children's safety, she dragged Guy and shepherded the Sect's "upper management" into the largest meeting room and plopped Guy right at the centre of the crowd.

"What do you mean that you aren't from this world?" Grace exclaimed in shock.

"It is exactly as I said," Guy affirmed. "I'm not the Guy who was born in this world- well the body was born in this world, but the soul inhabiting it wasn't born here."

"There's another soul inside this body?" Jean inquired while rubbing her chin.

"Yes- well I'd say there are two souls inside this body, technically," Guy answered with an awkward smile.

"So the old Guy Larks is still in there?" Grace asked.

"No, the old Guy is dead, I'm the new Guy," Guy corrected.

"So then who's the second soul?" Grace snapped irritatedly.

"He's the other Guy," Guy answered.

"Which other guy?" Grace asked.

"No, no, his name is also Guy, he's just another version of me, I think- Look it's all very complicated," Guy said finally while letting out an exhausted sigh. "Suffice to say, I died in my original world and my soul was brought into this world and injected into this body, who also happened to have the same name as me."

"Why this body in particular?" Grace asked while scrutinising Guy's body.

"I- Stop looking at me like that! It's very... uncomfortable," Guy exclaimed while covering his chest and crotch with an exaggerated, affronted look. ""

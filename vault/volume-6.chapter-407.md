Marie stepped into the small hut nestled in the heart of Twilight Village, a place once teeming with the vibrant presence of her Master. Time had not been kind to this humble abode; ever since the Sect relocated to the mountain, this hut had been left to the mercy of neglect and dust. The memories, however, lingered stubbornly, as vivid as the day they were made.

The air inside was stale, thick with dust motes dancing in the slivers of light piercing through the cracks. Marie made her way to her Master's old mattress, an island in a sea of forgotten times. She sat down, the familiar yet now foreign fabric beneath her offering little comfort. Her elbows found their way to her knees, and she buried her face in her hands, a dam holding back an ocean of sorrow.

A muffled wail broke from her, her palms barely containing the torrent of grief. The tears came unbidden, each one a testament to her loss. Her siblings, though safe, were far from her, and her Master, her mentor, her guide, had paid the ultimate price for their protection.

"Why?!" she cried out, her voice cracking under the weight of her anguish. "Why, why, why... WHY?!"

In the midst of her despair, Marie felt a presence beside her, quiet yet unmistakable. Before she could lift her head, a gentle hand wrapped around her, drawing her close. She felt her head being guided onto a comforting shoulder, a familiar, reassuring touch amidst the chaos of her emotions.

"It's okay," Shuri's voice was a soft whisper, a soothing balm to Marie's frayed nerves. "Let it all out."

Marie's defenses crumbled at the kindness in Shuri's embrace. She allowed herself to be vulnerable, to grieve without restraint. Her cries filled the hut, each sob a release of the pain she had been carrying. Shuri held her, a steadfast presence in the storm of Marie's sorrow, offering silent support and understanding.

As Marie's fit diminished, Shuri asked, "Would you liked to talk about what happened?"

"He's gone," Marie answered with a cracked voice. "He'd disappeared. And it's all my fault."

"Why?" Shuri responded. "Why do you think it is your fault?"

"Because..." Marie tried to come up with a response, an explanation of any kind, but her mind just didn't function. There were no thoughts left in her head anymore.

"I want to be alone for a little bit. Can you leave me here?" Marie asked.

"I don't think I can do that," Shuri responded. "When I was going through something like this, you didn't let me wallow in my own thoughts all alone. Even if you don't want to talk to me, let me be there with you. You can ignore me, I'll just sit over there in that corner silently."

"Please-"

"Don't argue over this," Shuri interjected while sucking in a sharp breath of air in protest. "You carry on as you were. Cry if you must, yell or swear if that helps. But don't collapse on me. I know that you are stronger than that. Do you think Elder Nara would wish to see you in this state?"

"Don't!" Marie snapped angrily.

Shuri raised her hand apologetically, "I guess its too soon. Well, I meant no offence."

Shuri pulled over a seat for herself, the same one Marie's Master loved to sit cross-legged on, and sat over at the corner as she had promised. Marie looked at the girl pointedly, before shaking her head and leaving the hut.

Marie chose to take a long walk, but was irked to notice that Shuri was still following her. Marie, in turn, activated her movement technique and built a hefty distance between herself and Shuri. But a few minutes later, she found the girl following her while breathing heavily. Since Shuri could no longer rely on her core to sustain herself, she was closer to a regular human. And so, exhaustion was something that couldn't be avoided.

"Why are you following me?!" Marie voiced her annoyance.

"I... told you. I can't... leave you... alone... when you... need me the most," Shuri said while wheezing. "Can... you slow down... please?!"

Marie clicked her tongue before sitting down by a nearby tree and resting her back against the trunk. "Take five!" She commanded Shuri, to which the girl smiled gratefully and plopped down on her back. Marie revealed a faint smile before it faded and turned into one filled with melancholy. She looked towards the clear blue skies and let herself dwell on a singular thought.

Her Master was gone... forever... and it was all her fault...

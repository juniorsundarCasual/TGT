"Is it just us three, today?" Kili asked Dora and Kano. The trio were at the outskirts of the woods near the Sect, in a relatively safe and open area.

"Yeah, I think we have to reduce the frequency of our weekly game sessions," Kano pointed out. "Not a lot of people tend to show up at the start of the week."

"Eh, you know what they say, if you work hard, you've got to play just as hard," Dora cut in while jabbing Kano with her elbow.

"So what's the game today?" Kili asked while excitedly rubbing her palms together. "Cops and Robbers? Freeze-Tag? Hide-and-Seek?"

""Hide-and-Seek,"" Kano and Dora said in unison. Kili gave the twins a weird look, to which Dora clarified with a wry smile, "Ever you started working out with Miss Maddi, you've gotten crazy fast. If you're "It" there's no way any of us stand a chance, so..."

"Oh man!" Kili groaned. "I promise I'll tone it down."

"That's no fun either," Kano denied. "For you, that is."

"Oh, okay..." Kili mumbled with a low mumble. "So, who goes first?"

"Majority wins!" Dora declared as she placed her hand at the centre of the huddle. Kano and Kili joined in with their hands.

"~Majority~Wins!~" Dora said in a sing-song voice, at the end of which everyone raised their hand and brought it down either face up or face down. Kano and Kili had theirs face down while Dora's was face-up.

"I'm it!" Dora yelled before turning and running up to the nearest tree.

"1... 2... 3... 4...," she counted at a steady pace, allowing her friends to run around and find a place to hide themselves. Kano found a pile of leaves and hid himself inside. Kili, on the other hand, found a tall tree and scampered up it at an unbelievable speed, hiding herself amidst the branches.

"49... 50! Ready or not, here I come!" Dora warned out loud. She then scanned the area around her for a few seconds before revealing a sly smile. She looked atop the tree she was counting at and asked.

"Did you see where they went?"

And from the tree, came a series of chirps in earnest.

"Thank you, good sir! I will make sure to add more sunflower seeds in your bowl from tomorrow onwards," Dora responded while giving a salute. The branches rustled before a hefty sparrow flew away. Its wings struggled to keep its bloated form afloat, but it managed nonetheless.

Dora floundered around a little before beelining straight towards the pile of leaves Kano was hiding under.

"Found you!" She yelled as she leapt into the leaf pile. A few seconds later, she wrestled her twin out and held him in a neck lock.

"Let... Me... GO!" Kano said while fighting back his sister's vice grip. The grapple lasted for a few seconds and then Dora released him while giggled uncontrollably.

"You cheated!" Kano accused. "You barely took any time in finding me."

"It's not my fault that you're a lousy hider!" Dora defended. She then harrumphed and started to walk another direction, towards the tall tree that was also Kili's hiding spot. SHe bent down and started to sniff around and randomly inspect the soil in the surrounding area. After a few prefuntory gestures, she looked up and yelled, "Found you! Come down."

Almost immediately, Kili slid down the tree with an enraged look on her face.

"I saw what you did! You cheated! You talked to that fat bird Durkas keeps feeding!" Kili accused.

"I knew it!" Kano chimed in. "You couldn't have found us so quickly without outside help."

Dora let out a scandalous gasp and said, "I did no such thing!"

Kili and Kano simultaneously dogpiled on Dora, the former held her upper body in a leglock while the latter started to tickle his sister continuously.

"S-STOP!" Dora yelled between uncontrolled laughted. "S-STOP IT!"

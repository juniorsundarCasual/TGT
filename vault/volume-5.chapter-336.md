It was a dark and moonless night, with only the faint light from the stars illuminating the budding forest. The density of trees here was sparse, with signs of uprooting and replanting evident all around. The ground was patchy with greenery, and there was an uneven distribution of flowers and other flora. The place was mostly silent, which was interrupted intermittently by the drones of crickets projecting their presence to others of their kind.

One could say that it was peaceful... a little too peaceful. It felt like the calm before a storm. Though it was strangely ominous for a metaphorical storm to come so soon after rampaging and devastating these lands. These were the plagued lands of the Solar Empire; this was the region that once lay ravaged and abandoned by the Plague of Dark Cleansing.

The sound of a fallen branch cracking echoed. A man walked on with a limp on his right side, but his speed did not match that of an injured individual. His eyes were dark and sunken, his face pale and sickly, and his expression alternated haphazardly between malevolence and disdain.

He walked until he reached the centre of the reformed region, and scanned the surrounding area with a confused gaze. His brows furrowed into a frown and a snarl escaped his lips. He crouched, dipped his hands into the soil and lifted a handful of rich dirt. He held it at eye level and waited, as through the centre of the mound slithered out a thick, pink earthworm. The man let the dirt sift through his fingers, and captured the worm between his thumb and index. The worm struggled fearfully as it was brought closer to its captor's eyes.

The man ground his teeth harder the more the worm struggled, until a malicious sneer cracked his pale face in two. His lips puckered and parted, and a gust of dark wind escaped them. The gust enveloped the worm completely, before dissipating into the air.

The man waited.

But the worm's struggle did not cede. His brows rose in shock, before unfettered rage drowned all the emotion in his face. A purple spell circle formed around the worm before the creature disintegrated into nothingness.

His enraged eyes darted around, growing more agitated with each living creature that got caught in his view. A spell circle formed on his right palm, which he raised and - with a loud bellow - plunged it into the ground. The ground rippled and cracked as an ethereal purple light spread outwards. The grass where his fist entered the soil grew diseased and started to spread outwards. But after moving six metres from the source, the spread ceased.

The maddened smile on the man's face cracked and turned into a deeper shade of confusion.

"What is this?" He rasped in shock. At that moment, his eyes widened, and he raised both his arms instinctively. An explosion broke in front of him, dispersing upon the hastily cast |Ward| spell.

"Attacking an unprepared individual, how dishonourable-" the man said with a derisive snort. "-Teacher Jeeves."

"You've lost the privilege of calling me that, Ziva," an elderly voice responded as another man came into view from behind a nearby tree. With a smirk, he said, "Surprised to see your 'masterpiece' ruined?"

"This?" Ziva scoffed while trying to mask his true emotions from revealing itself. "I don't believe in looking back. My Plague has already achieved its purpose."

"Don't lie to me, Ziva. You can't even lie convincingly to fool yourself," Al responded with an uproarious laugh. "You forget that I've taught you for over thirty years. I practically raised you, BOY! This must be really grinding you from within. You were never one to take a loss of face lightly, even if it was inconsequential."

"ENOUGH!" Ziva snapped back. "Who did it? It can't be you. And don't try to fool me, I've studied under you for over thirty years, after all."

With a self-deprecating smile, Al responded, "Right. Thirty years we spent together. None of it mattered, in the end, did it? I was just a means to an end for you."

"Stop deflecting, old man!" Ziva interjected. "Tell me who did this, or I will "

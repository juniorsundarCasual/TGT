It was a dark and moonless night, with only the faint light from the stars illuminating the budding forest. The density of trees here was sparse, with signs of uprooting and replanting evident all around. The ground was patchy with greenery, and there was an uneven distribution of flowers and other flora. The place was mostly silent, which was interrupted intermittently by the drones of crickets projecting their presence to others of their kind.

One could say that it was peaceful... a little too peaceful. It felt like the calm before a storm. Though it was strangely ominous for a metaphorical storm to come so soon after rampaging and devastating these lands. These were the plagued lands of the Solar Empire; this was the region that once lay ravaged and abandoned by the Plague of Dark Cleansing.

The sound of a fallen branch cracking echoed. A man walked on with a limp on his right side, but his speed did not match that of an injured individual. His eyes were dark and sunken, his face pale and sickly, and his expression alternated haphazardly between malevolence and disdain.

He walked until he reached the centre of the reformed region, and scanned the surrounding area with a confused gaze. His brows furrowed into a frown and a snarl escaped his lips. He crouched, dipped his hands into the soil and lifted a handful of rich dirt. He held it at eye level and waited, as through the centre of the mound slithered out a thick, pink earthworm. The man let the dirt sift through his fingers, and captured the worm between his thumb and index. The worm struggled fearfully as it was brought closer to its captor's eyes.

The man ground his teeth harder the more the worm struggled, until a malicious sneer cracked his pale face in two. His lips puckered and parted, and a gust of dark wind escaped them. The gust enveloped the worm completely, before dissipating into the air.

The man waited.

But the worm's struggle did not cede. His brows rose in shock, before unfettered rage drowned all the emotion in his face. A purple spell circle formed around the worm before the creature disintegrated into nothingness.

His enraged eyes darted around, growing more agitated with each living creature that got caught in his view. A spell circle formed on his right palm, which he raised and - with a loud bellow - plunged it into the ground. The ground rippled and cracked as an ethereal purple light spread outwards. The grass where his fist entered the soil grew diseased and started to spread outwards. But after moving six metres from the source, the spread ceased.

The maddened smile on the man's face cracked and turned into a deeper shade of confusion.

"What is this?" He rasped in shock. At that moment, his eyes widened, and he raised both his arms instinctively. An explosion broke in front of him, dispersing upon the hastily cast |Ward| spell.

"Attacking an unprepared individual, how dishonourable-" the man said with a derisive snort. "-Teacher Jeeves."

"You've lost the privilege of calling me that, Ziva," an elderly voice responded as another man came into view from behind a nearby tree. With a smirk, he said, "Surprised to see your 'masterpiece' ruined?"

"This?" Ziva scoffed while trying to mask his true emotions from revealing itself. "I don't believe in looking back. My Plague has already achieved its purpose."

"Don't lie to me, Ziva. You can't even lie convincingly to fool yourself," Al responded with an uproarious laugh. "You forget that I've taught you for over thirty years. I practically raised you, BOY! This must be really grinding you from within. You were never one to take a loss of face lightly, even if it was inconsequential."

"ENOUGH!" Ziva snapped back. "Who did it? It can't be you. And don't try to fool me, I've studied under you for over thirty years, after all."

With a self-deprecating smile, Al responded, "Right. Thirty years we spent together. None of it mattered, in the end, did it? I was just a means to an end for you."

"Stop deflecting, old man!" Ziva interjected. "Tell me who did this, or I will draw the answer out of you."

"Oh," Al drawled, noticing the new emotion flashing past his ex-Student's face. "You are afraid. Oh, this is just precious!"

"I'M. NOT. AFRAID!" Ziva declared loudly and with force, though the words themselves rang hollow - like that of a child throwing a tantrum.

"You thought your little spell would shake the world for generations, didn't you?" Al taunted. "It barely made it into its teen years. How does that make you feel?"

Ziva's fists clenched in anger, and his gaze sharpened with the intensity of a thousand swords. "WHO. DID. THIS?"

"I won't give you that satisfaction, boy," Al said with a mocking laugh. Then, suddenly, his expression turned serious. "Besides, it won't matter any ways. You won't be leaving this place alive."

With a fraction of a second, three spells - |Flamestrike|, |Air Cutter| and |Water Jet| - left Al's open palms and pushed against Ziva. Unfortunately, his opponent was prepared, and with a wave of his hand a massive spell circle formed that consumed the three spells to form a whirling, multicoloured ball.

"Thirty years, Teacher," Ziva said with a strained smile. "I know all of your tricks!"

Ziva spun around and ejected the ball back towards Al, who evaded between the trees. Instead of colliding against the obstacles before him, the ball, however, started to deviate irregularly and followed Al as he went. At that moment, Al noticed that Ziva still had the spell activated. Quickly cycling through his most frequently used and familiar movement arts, Al started to glide around the battlefield while simultaneously wrangling for control in his and his ex-Student's overlapping mana domains.

'He's broken through once again!' Al noticed. The boy had basically closed the gap between them, realm-wise. Fortunately, though, the breakthrough was fairly recent since his control over his domain matched that of someone of a lower stage. Within seconds, the connection between the seeking ball and Ziva was untethered, which Al used to transition into the offensive. He activated a spell circle similar to Ziva's and converted the whirling, multicoloured ball into a snaking shape. He then directed it to attack Ziva, who once again deflected the attack with a |Ward|.

"Still as impatient as always," Al chided. "Relying on warding spells to protect yourself instead of using your brain. Haven't I taught you better?"

Without allowing for Ziva to retort, Al continued, "Today, I will teach you a valuable lesson, boy."

At that instant, five identical spell circles formed around Al. Ziva squinted his eyes as he tried to decipher the mundane yet unique design; he'd never seen this spell circle before. He'd never seen his ex-Teacher use whatever this spell was before. But he didn't panic. Because he could see that the spell was simple and small - nothing too complex.

But his relaxed smile froze when he noticed his ex-Teacher's trademark smirk.

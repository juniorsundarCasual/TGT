After the hubbub settled, Guy took the podium and addressed the crowd. "This concludes the Rebuttal segment of the debate. Now, we move on to the deliberation segment. This is where YOU-" he gestured towards the audience and judges, "-get to decide who the winner of this debate is."

With that said, the crowd dispersed for a short break, and the judges shuffled out into a different room to deliberate on whom the winner should be. Guy allotted half an hour for the judges to come to terms. As he entered the room with them, though, he was greeted with a heated debate taking place already.

"Team 1 had a more structured argumentation. Especially their closing rebuttals, they captured the weaknesses of the opposing team concisely-" Markus said.

But he was interjected by Marie, who argued, "But they failed to properly prop up their own argument. I think Team 2 did better in that regard. While Team 1 had a better rebuttal, Team 2 had a more robust construction."

"Is that how we decide the winner, though?" Shuri cut in. "Isn't it about which definition is better amongst the two?"

At that point, Elder Nara cut in and said, "That's where you are wrong, girl."

All heads turned towards the elderly man, and he expounded on his point, "Imagine this was a fight between two combatants. The purpose of the fight is to apply the knowledge gained from a particular martial art. One combatant manages to knock out the other. Would you award the prize to the loser, just because their understanding of the martial art, and their form was far superior to the latter?"

"I wouldn't," Shuri answered with a defeated sigh. "But this is different-"

"Is it, though?" Elder Nara challenged. "The debate isn't about which side is right, it is about which side presented the most structured and convincing argument. Do not let your bias enter into the decision-making process. If you do that, then you aren't evaluating the debaters, you are evaluating the topic itself. And in that case, you don't even need people to debate for you, you might as well just read the reports and construct your own judgement from that."

At this moment, Guy decided to step in and said, "I agree with Elder Nara. The debate is all about the arguments, not the topic itself. Heck, we could have a debate discussing the 'morality of throwing puppies as an entertainment sport', and the team arguing in favour could still win if their points are well-structured and supported."

"That's a rather dark example," Elder Nara admitted with a light chuckle.

The others nodded contemplatively as they digested this input.

"So, do we have a consensus?" Guy probed again.

"Even with what Master said, we are at an impasse," Marie jumped in. "You see, Shuri and I stand behind Team 2, while Master and Markus are with Team 1."

"Why is that?" Guy asked while leaning against a desk.

"We think that Team 2's arguments were more critical on the far-reaching consequences of Definition 1. Especially the nature of standardisation and how it is reliant on a singular body to maintain uniformity," Shuri chimed in. "Senior Sister Marie and I believe that the down-the-line implications are extremely crucial, which was well addressed by Team 2, not so much by Team 1."

"On the other hand," Markus carried over. "Elder Nara and I believe that the highlighted pseudo-open-endedness in Definition 2, especially in how they used mass conservation as an analogue for comparison, is a problem factor. The debate was to learn which side has the better definition, it is evident that while Definition 1 may not be the best, it is still better than Definition 2."

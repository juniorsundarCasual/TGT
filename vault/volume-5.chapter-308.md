Shuri realised that her fears concerning the True World Sect were warranted. It was a metaphorical drug house of temptations tailored to Shuri's subconscious wants. Every time she tried to get out of the alluring path, she would be teased with a sweet nectar and drawn back in. It was frustrating, to say the least, since her rationality had to constantly fight with her subconscious from getting drawn in by the bait hanging in front of her. Unfortunately, till now, she had been failing. Shuri had never experienced so many continuous setbacks in her entire life!

"Back to the matter at hand though..."

She suspected that this whole "Innovator Track" nonsense was just another one of those baits meant to reign her in and control her. This was their strategy, after all. Shuri noted that everytime she stumbled into a trap it was through her own volition. She was offered a choice, and each time the logically better choice would draw her deeper into the trap. It was like playing chess against an opponent who already knew the ending and was cornering her towards that configuration with every step... Kind of like when she competed with Marie...

A tired sigh escaped Shuri's lips as she collapsed into her bed. As there were very few people in the Sect, all new members had the luxury of sleeping in their own rooms. Of course this could only be enjoyed until the subsequent rounds of recruitment. Shuri wasn't certain if she would remain here for that long. The way things were going, she may have to bring forward her liberation date.

Shuri closed her eyes and tried to get some rest, but sleep kept evading her. Fed up with rolling about ceaselessly, she snapped up and started to walk around her room while in contemplation. Unfortunately, her mind was also agitated making it hard to focus on one coherent line of thought.

Exasperated, she pulled out the chair tucked beneath her study table and collapsed onto it. Her head hanged back, over the top of the chair, and rolled around in boredom.

"What do I do?" Shuri voiced her aggravation. She covered her face with both her palms and rubbed it vigorously, moving upwards and shuffling her hair as well. Her left-hand then moved subconsciously towards the eerie pendant hanging around her neck and fiddled with it. Shuri's eyes unfocused and looked around the room lazily. At that moment, as her pupils scampered over the empty walls, they stopped over the cloth bag Shuri brought with her.

Shuri bit her lips as her flustered thoughts narrowed and considered something. With cautious steps she approached the cloth bag and pulled out a bundle from within. Unfastening the ropes of the bundle revealed a stack of books.

"Guide to Cross-Stitching for Single Men."

"Ten Easy Ways to Cook Common Tilapia."

"Six-Hundred and Sixty-Six Jokes from the East."

Shuri suppressed a smirk before carefully opening the first book. She skimmed past the first six pages, before another domineeringly large calligraphy jumped out.

"Golems, Automatons, and Magborgs."

She'd read this book before. In fact she'd read the other two as well: "Farming Blank Mana Cores." and "Core Forging."

This was all that remained of the Yoruz Clan's coveted and equally despised magical arts.

No one likes necromancy. It is the process of splitting one's soul into small segments and inhabiting corpses, kind of like creating your own tamed beast. People don't like it primarily because the process tends to desecrate the bodies of the dead, which is generally seen as "morally corrupt". But the truth behind the hatred of this practise is because the cultivation method is a force multiplier. One can essentially create endless bodies as swords and shields to carry out their will without having to step foot on the battlefield. Of course, doing so for a long time period is damaging to the caster's soul, which is often why necromancers tend to go off the hook and become destructive.

The Yoruz Clan wasn't one that practised necromancy, but their cultivation method toed that line. It was a force multiplier, but without the downside of being "morally corrupt". Instead of splitting souls, the process called for the creation of multiple wills: golems or automatons. These contraptions had a predetermined purpose in life. Unlike reanimated corpses, they weren't soul bound to their creator, but as a result, there was no backlash from their destruction. Furthermore, unlike reanimated corpses, these manifestations of will could not grow stronger like an average mage since they lacked spirituality. However, they could be made strong from the very beginning as long as the blank mana core going into creating them was at that level.

Ultimately, these contraptions were the perfect tools as they pursued their programmed task with a persistence and efficiency unachievable by a sentient being. They worked well in groups, as long as their programming matched. They worked well in any condition, as long as they are built with materials matching the work environment. They did not fear or tire, nor did they have ambition. Their job was their life and their life was their job.

Shuri ran her fingertips over the yellowed pages that were starting to show their age. This was all that remained of the clan her dearest mother fared from. These books were, at first glance, contained cursory reference about the many contraptions a Yoruz mage could unleash into the world. They offered nothing deeper beyond that. However, for someone versed in the Clan's secret cypher, they would find a whole other book hidden within these pages.

"No one must ever know of these! Learn from them. Master them. Use them to survive," Her mother told her once as she stuffed them into her hands. It was a time when she still had a strand of sanity left. Shuri didn't like remembering those times. She would rather remember her mother has a dessicated, hateful, mad-woman - it made sorting out her emotions easier.

Shuri had already deciphered and memorised all of these books. At one point she even tried to secretly cultivate using the method. Unfortunately, she could not resonate with it. She couldn't even properly resonate with the Sol Clan's domineering Burning Sun Method. She understood it well, but she could not accept it at a psychological level. Maybe it was the subconsious hatred for anything to do with her lineage, be it her mother or her father.

She flipped through the pages, scanning the words with a dreary gaze. There was little enjoyment in rereading when the first reading still remained fresh in her mind. But it offered sufficient distraction to quell her thoughts.

"Wisps and slimes are, on paper, one of the most useless creatures in existance. They lack offensive and defensive capabilities, and are weak to even the most basic attacks for the simple fact that their body is incapable of protecting their weakest point - their core. This brings us to the second point: a dead wisp and slime are, on paper, one of the most useful creatures in existance..."

"...Wisps and slimes form when the concentration of mana in a particular region rises above a certain limit. Additionally, if the environment is dark, closed and pressurised, the conditions are perfect for the spawning of these creatures. Interestingly, the birth of wisps and slimes follows a drastic drop of mana concentration in the surrounding region as the spawning essentially creates a mana sink."

Shuri lowered the book and started to mutter out loud, "Mana sink... mana sink... mana sink..."

Why did that sound familiar?

People assume that having an eidetic memory means that memory recollection could be achieved in a pinch. While true, there is a caveat. People tie their emotions with experiences, and sometimes it is true with knowledge as well. Knowledge that is ingrained and abstracted is separate from the experiences under which it was gained, but knowledge which is raw and memorised is often tethered to the instance where it took place. Shuri's mind could remember even the tiniest of details in passing, given that she could first recollect the macrospecifics of the passing instance. She could remember the exact shape of a person's toe as long as she could remember the fact that she saw it while playing football with the person that one time. It may sound counterintuitive, but the human mind had limitations.

She had heard mana sink before, in passing. However, she could not pinpoint that vague instance. The phrase repeated in her mind until sleep finally pulled her into an inviting embrace. Upon waking up, it continued to repeat itself.

On this day, her schedule had shifted. Instead of going for regular classes, everyone was pulled out for an impromptu session of crafts in the Maker-Space. This was being led by Sect Leader Larks. The goal of the lesson was to weave a basket using wood and wood fibres. Shuri did not understand what the purpose of this exercise was, but she wasn't going to question it. For one, she'd rather not willingly paint a target on her back and two, the exercise was strangely calming.

The mundane chant of, "fold, pull, fold, twist, fold, weave..." kept repeating in her mind and drowned off the doning "mana sink". Unknowingly, she had completed a basket. She looked around, trying to hide the welling pride, only to see that her peers had completed three within the same timeframe. It appeared that their upbringing had
worked to their advantage.

"Good job, everyone! Since we're all able to wicker, we will be moving ahead to the next step," Sect Leader Larks declared. He waved his hands and Markus, Jean and Marie walked in with three large sacks of material, while Kano and Dora followed them in while carrying a locked wooden crate.

"Today, is a momentous occassion for everyone, since we will be crafting out own magic wand," Sect Leader Larks said with a beaming smile while revealing the contents of the sack. "A magic wand is made with these two primary materials: Illuminescent Banyan sinews and Menryl wood."

One sack contained varing lengths of branches from the Menryl Tree while the remaining two sacks contained uniform sinews of the Banyan. Sect Leader Larks pulled out a wooden branch and placed it on the lathe machine. With the pull of a lever, the clutch moved the gears in the gearbox into place and completed the mechanical circuit extracting energy from the nearby flowing stream and pushed the lathe into a whirling movement.

"How many of you have partaken in the safety courses to operate the lathe?"

Shuri raised her hand with a handful of others.

"Those with their hands raised will be tasked with turning one for yourself and two more for your peers without safety certification," Sect Leader Larks commanded after counting out the student. He then put on a transparent mask over his eyes.

"Glasses on for safety!"

And then he got down to work.

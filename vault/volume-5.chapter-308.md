Shuri realised that her fears concerning the True World Sect were warranted. It was a metaphorical drug house of temptations tailored to Shuri's subconscious wants. Every time she tried to get out of the alluring path, she would be teased with a sweet nectar and drawn back in. It was frustrating, to say the least, since her rationality had to constantly fight with her subconscious from getting drawn in by the bait hanging in front of her. Unfortunately, till now, she had been failing. Shuri had never experienced so many continuous setbacks in her entire life!

"Back to the matter at hand though..."

She suspected that this whole "Innovator Track" nonsense was just another one of those baits meant to reign her in and control her. This was their strategy, after all. Shuri noted that everytime she stumbled into a trap it was through her own volition. She was offered a choice, and each time the logically better choice would draw her deeper into the trap. It was like playing chess against an opponent who already knew the ending and was cornering her towards that configuration with every step... Kind of like when she competed with Marie...

A tired sigh escaped Shuri's lips as she collapsed into her bed. As there were very few people in the Sect, all new members had the luxury of sleeping in their own rooms. Of course this could only be enjoyed until the subsequent rounds of recruitment. Shuri wasn't certain if she would remain here for that long. The way things were going, she may have to bring forward her liberation date.

Shuri closed her eyes and tried to get some rest, but sleep kept evading her. Fed up with rolling about ceaselessly, she snapped up and started to walk around her room while in contemplation. Unfortunately, her mind was also agitated making it hard to focus on one coherent line of thought.

Exasperated, she pulled out the chair tucked beneath her study table and collapsed onto it. Her head hanged back, over the top of the chair, and rolled around in boredom.

"What do I do?" Shuri voiced her aggravation. She covered her face with both her palms and rubbed it vigorously, moving upwards and shuffling her hair as well. Her left-hand then moved subconsciously towards the eerie pendant hanging around her neck and fiddled with it. Shuri's eyes unfocused and looked around the room lazily. At that moment, as her pupils scampered over the empty walls, they stopped over the cloth bag Shuri brought with her.

Shuri bit her lips as her flustered thoughts narrowed and considered something. With cautious steps she approached the cloth bag and pulled out a bundle from within. Unfastening the ropes of the bundle revealed a stack of books.

"Guide to Cross-Stitching for Single Men."

"Ten Easy Ways to Cook Common Tilapia."

"Six-Hundred and Sixty-Six Jokes from the East."

Shuri suppressed a smirk before carefully opening the first book. She skimmed past the first six pages, before another domineeringly large calligraphy jumped out.

"Golems, Automatons, and Magborgs."

She'd read this book before. In fact she'd read the other two as well: "Farming Blank Mana Cores." and "Core Forging."

This was all that remained of the Yoruz Clan's coveted and equally despised cultivation arts.

No one likes necromancy. It is the process of splitting one's soul into small segments and inhabiting corpses, kind of like creating your own tamed beast. People don't like it primarily because the process tends to desecrate the bodies of the dead, which is generally seen as "morally corrupt". But the truth behind the hatred of this practise is because the cultivation method is a force multiplier. One can essentially create endless bodies as swords and shields to carry out their will without having to step foot on the battlefield. Of course, doing so for a long time period is damaging to the caster's soul, which is often why necromancers tend to go off the hook and become destructive.

The Yoruz Clan wasn't one that practised necromancy, but their cultivation method toed that line. It was a force multiplier, but without the downside of being "morally corrupt". Instead of splitting souls, the process called for the creation of multiple wills: golems or automatons. These contraptions had a predetermined purpose in life. Unlike reanimated corpses, they weren't soul bound to their creator, but as a result, there was no backlash from their destruction. Furthermore, unlike reanimated corpses, these manifestations of will could not grow stronger like an average mage since they lacked spirituality. However, they could be made strong from the very beginning as long as the blank mana core going into creating them was at that level.

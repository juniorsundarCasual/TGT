Revian was excited as entered the Solar Sect Alliance's recruitment grounds. Not even the shoudler-to-shoulder traffic at the entrance as people siphoned through the criminally narrow gates could dampen his elation. But it did worry him a bit. The anxiety only grew in intesity as the crowd ceased to disperse and moved collectively in the same direction. Then, at a juncture, it split in two equally. Then once again at a subsequent juncture, jet the net quantity evoked a sense of foreboding.

A few seconds later, he realised that his stress wasn't unwarranted... Why? Because every single person entering the ground today had the same goal in mind and that was to test their luck with the Four Greats: the Cloudstrider Sect, the Whispering Dusk Sect, the Soaring Sword Sect, and the Red Dawn Sect.

Guy braced himself as the ground started to visibly shake. Seconds later, a massive horde rushed past the kiosk and disappeared around the corner.

"So many people..." He muttered. Turning to face his Disciple, he managed to catch Markus as he down an anxious gulp of saliva.

"Master... Will we get visitors?" Markus probed as eh voiced his uncertainty.

"Don't worry! There will always be someone. Besides, as long as Jean succeeds in distributing all the leaflets, at least a handful of people will stop by if not to join then at least to check out what our Sect is about," Guy responded, assuaging his Disciple.

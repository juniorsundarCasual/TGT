The Emperor slammed his fist on the Throne's arm rest, causing a heavy boom to echo across the room. A charged silence took hold, as all the nonsensical bickering ceased instantaneously. The room was massive in scale, with the throne placed prominently on a raised stand at the very back. Banners with the symbol of the Sol Clan flanked the throne on either side, and an elegant red carpet rolled from underneath the throne towards the exit on the opposite end. To either side of the carpet, stood two lines of men garbed in the attire attributed to the highest ranks on the Empire's Government - the Ministers responsible for every governing body.

"All I've been hearing are excuses, upon excuses, upon excuses," the Emperor growled. With each pause, he pummelled his fist on the armrest to accentuate his displeasure. "It's been a whole day! The entirety of the Capital's Authorities have been dispatched on the case. And yet, none of you can tell me WHO was behind it, or WHY they did it?"

"You Majesty," a 'brave' official stepped forth. Controlling, albeit unsuccessfully, his chattering teeth he responded, "These are unusual circumstances. Usually, the terrorist organisations release some sort of manifesto or declaration to sign their name and cause behind their act of terror. Yet this... group has been strangely silent."

The Emperor shot the man a deathly glare before rising abruptly from his Mithril-infused Gold-Adamantium Throne. The seat was laden with one of the largest Mana Gems in existence that cycled between every colour on the visible spectrum. It was a symbol of the Sol Clan's power, though it only came to be during the reign of the Third Emperor. The many years of peace and stagnation within the Empire had fostered a sense of disillusionment with the Emperor's Power amongst the common people. Hence, to prove his might, the Third Emperor had the throne built - crafted by three 5-star Blacksmiths and two 5-star Enchanters, the decadent piece of furnite was the epitome of excess. It was capable of withstanding attacks that could level an entire city AND its form adapted to match the shape of the person sitting on it while also offering unparalleled cushioning. Furthermore, it only allowed those with Sol blood flowing through their veins to rest their posterior on it. This was also how the originally crowned Fourth Emperor was discredited - as the moment his thighs touched the throne's metal, his body disintegrated completely.  

"So you're telling me that just about anyone can enter the Capital, wreack havoc, and get away with it without any consequences?" The Emperor interrogated, standing half-an-arm's length away from the 'brave' official.

"Y-Your Majesty-"

"They literally ENTERED my backyard, DESECRATED it, and LEFT! How does it reflect upon the Empire if we cannot even police the city the Throne is situated in?!"

Once again, silence.

"Alright, I see how it is," the Emperor commented while returning to the throne. "If it is incentives that you need, it is incentives you shall receive."

"Minister Graves!" He bellowed, and a man standing in the line by the carpet flinched. Collecting himself, he immediately rushed onto the carpet, faced the throne, and kneeled.

"It appears that you time as the Minister of Internal Security has been..." his eyes locked on to the man's overflowing fat that not even the loosely fitting uniform could hide "... relaxed?"

"No, Your Majesty!" The man responded.

"Well, I have learned through my time with the Royal Tutor that the best way to manage people is through the 'Carrot and Stick' approach. The 'Carrot' refers to rewards, that one can use to motivate others to act, while the 'Stick' alludes to punishment. It appears that your position as the Minister of Internal Security has allowed you to accumulate a lot of... 'Carrots'. However, it has amounted to nothing. Thus it appears that it is time for the 'Stick'. Let this be known, that the penalty for every day that passes without any progress in the investigation into the terror attack at the Capital... is one finger."

"Your Majesty?" The man yelped in shock.

"Let them think of me as a tyrant," the Emperor declared. "I rather be referred to as a tyrant than a stooge."

"But I will make your life easier," the Emperor looked behind the kneeling minister and transmitted commands to the guards stationed around the room. "I shall loan you one hundred from the Imperial Forces."

A group of men in heavy armour of polished metal marched to the Minister's side and saluted the Emperor.

"T-Thank you for your graciousness, Your Majesty," the minister fawned. But right as he was about to rise, a heavy hand descended on his back and held him in place. One of the armoured men dragged forward a table and placed it before him.

"It has already been a day, Minister Graves," the Emperor revealed with a dangerous edge in his voice.

The armoured man who brought the table pulled the minister's left-hand forward and grasped his pinkie finger with a vice grip and pressed it against the table.

"Y-Your Maj-"

With a deft movement, the armoured man slashed a dagger from his belt, causing the finger to separate from the hand. He then pushed his metal glove, which was a shade of luminescent red after being heated, against the wound causing it to cauterise instantly.

"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!" The minister shrieked as he held his left hand, short of one finger.

"You have nine more days," the Emperor joked. "Make them count, or you may lose the ability to count altogether."

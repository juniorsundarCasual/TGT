"Ninety-nine!"

"Hundred!"

"Eyhup!" Kili yelled as she did a kip up on the pull-up bar, planted her foot on it, and seamlessly transitioned into a backflip and a steady landing.

"That's five more than yesterday, right?" Kili asked Rianna, who was struggling hard to stop her eyes from popping out of her sockets. "Prog-Progressive overload, right?"

Rianna coughed loudly and affirmed with a wavering voice, "Yeah! Good job. You've hit a new personal best. For the next set, why don't we add some weight since you can support your body well enough."

"That's too fast, isn't it?" Shay-Hade chimed in. "Is she ready for weights?"

"She started with just ten garbage pull-up reps and pushed it all the way to a perfect hundred in four weeks. It's the same with the push-up, free-squat, dips, and overhead presses! There's nothing more to gain with just raising the reps just so that she can reach saturation. It's a waste of time."

"Am I doing good?" Kili inquired worriedly, as she noticed the two adults talking animately on the side.

"A hero does good," Rianna responded while tapping the kid's forehead, "You're doing well. Very well."

"So, what's next?" Kili prompted.

"What did I tell you? Thirty seconds of rest between each set to let the muscle recover and your motor neurons to prepare themselves for the upcoming load," Rianna orated.

"But I'm perfectly fine and ready for the next set-" Kili started, but was immediately silenced with a low growl.

"Stick to the process," Rianna reiterated. "If you deviate, then you lose everything!"

Kili flinched at Rianna's forceful retort. She then nodded with a resolute expression and started to stretch her back muscles, awaiting the time to start her next set.

"Do you really have to be so strict?" Shay-Hade whispered.

"You weren't here, so you missed it," Rianna said.

"Rules and regularity," Jean declared as she rapped the blackboard behind her which had the two words written in all capital and bold typeface.

"The hell is that supposed to mean?" Rianna snapped back. She was sitting on a seat that was way too small for her size. "And why are we in this tiny classroom?"

"This was the only one available on short notice! The kindergarteners from the village finish early," Jean answered. "Now focus!"

"There's literally only two words to focus on!" Rianna argued. "Get on with it."

"Actions have consequences," Jean started. "That is a known fact. But how do you know that action A has consequence A? What if it was consequence B from an action B that occured some time back?"

Rianna raised a hand and said, "You lost me."

"I just started!" Jean exclaimed.

"Try again," Rianna dismissed with an annoyed growl.

Jean took a long breath in to calm down the bubbling anger and let it all out in one long exhale. "When you were young, were you ever told not to swim after eating?"

"Yeah, or else you'd get cramps," Rianna responded.

"I bet you did it anyways, right?" Jean asked rhetorically. "You ended up getting cramps and realised that, 'Hey, maybe rules are there for a reason?'"


"The point is that rules exist for a reason. If the reason is based on sound logic with measurable results, then following it becomes a habit. Inculcating a habit transitions into a point of regularity. How many times have you heard the phrase, 'Its been like this for a long time...'?" Jean emphasised. "When a rule becomes a point of regularity, it is followed without question. But to do that, you have to get over the primary hump of verification. Fortunately, for kids, all it takes is a single, undeniable, instance of verification compared to teens and adults who are far more observant and capable of detecting deviations."

"So what you're saying is that I need to define the workout plan as a rule. I allow it to show its results, and then once they become visible, Kili will automatically adopt the rules as points of regularity," Rianna summarised.

"Exactly! But the most important point is that you need to show progress," Jean highlighted. "Progress is key. If Kili's physique needs to take over, she needs to believe that whatever she is doing is actually leading to improvements. No amount of lip service can replace the importance of displaying tangible results."

"Once the belief takes hold, then her physique should take over," Rianna continued, finishing Jean's thought.

"So you only have one shot at this. Plan properly and execute thoroughly," Jean instructed.

"You know, I didn't think you would be a part of this 'scheme'," Rianna stated. "It's all a bit manipulative, isn't it? Doesn't come across as your style."

"I do it because it is necessary," Jean responded. "Her physique paints her as a target - a very desirable one at that. I am willing to go to any extent to protect her. I myself am incapable of causing harm - all the more reason for her to become stronger. You should know better than anyone just how horrible this world can be."

"In that, I am in agreement with you," Rianna answered with a hum.

"Very duplicitous of you," Shay-Hade commented.

"I am not lying to Kili," Rianna challenged. "You yourself witness just how explosively her body has evolved over the last month. The first month was used to convince the girl that her body is growing and developing. Once she realised that, then her physique slowly took over, resulting in this. What's so wrong with that?"

"Nothing good comes quickly and easily," Shay-Hade said, as though he were narrating a phrase from memory. "My father once found a Salah'ddin in the desert in one of his hunts. For your information, the Salah'ddin is known to be the meadow of the desert because of how useful it is. The large herbivore is capable of travelling long distances without water or sustenance, just like a camel. It can tunnel into the desert sand, making it able to travel very quickly. Even the males produce milk, which is nutritious and long lasting. It lives for a very long time as a magical beast, but upon its demise, its meat is densely packed with nutrients. The Salah'ddin is a solitary creature, and extremely territorial. Yet this one just conveniently followed my father the moment it laid eyes on him."

Shay-Hade paused and then said, "So, my father killed it. His hunting group cursed him for his actions, but the moment the creature took its last breath, it dissipated into dense black smoke and viscous liquid. It was Mimick!"

"My father always says, 'nothing good comes quickly and easily'," Shay-Hade reiterated. "There are consequences to power gained too quickly."

"But Kili is literally working for it, how is this a freebie?" Rianna reasoned.

"Even the most gifted of mages cannot celebrate the level of success the girl has displayed in this short time frame," Shay-Hade reminded. "It may all be going well now, but what of in the immediate or distant future?"

"What could possibly go wrong?"

Shay-Hade shook his head solemnly and said, "Do you wish to know so badly that you are willing to place the girl's future on the line? You have everything to lose and nothing to gain from testing your luck here."

"We could just ask Marie, you know?" Rianna suggested.

"I don't need a seer to tell me the consequences of my actions. I believe I am capable enough to deduce them on my own. I hope you are equally as wise," Shay-Hade pointed out and walked away. "Now if you will excuse me, I have a combat class to teach."

Rianna let out a

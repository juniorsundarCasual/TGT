"Ninety-nine!"

"Hundred!"

"Eyhup!" Kili yelled as she did a kip up on the pull-up bar, planted her foot on it, and seamlessly transitioned into a backflip and a steady landing.

"That's five more than yesterday, right?" Kili asked Rianna, who was struggling hard to stop her eyes from popping out of her sockets. "Prog-Progressive overload, right?"

Rianna coughed loudly and affirmed with a wavering voice, "Yeah! Good job. You've hit a new personal best. For the next set, why don't we add some weight since you can support your body well enough."

"That's too fast, isn't it?" Shay-Hade chimed in. "Is she ready for weights?"

"She started with just ten garbage pull-up reps and pushed it all the way to a perfect hundred in four weeks. It's the same with the push-up, free-squat, dips, and overhead presses! There's nothing more to gain with just raising the reps just so that she can reach saturation. It's a waste of time."

"Am I doing good?" Kili inquired worriedly, as she noticed the two adults talking animately on the side.

"A hero does good," Rianna responded while tapping the kid's forehead, "You're doing well. Very well."

"So, what's next?" Kili prompted.

"What did I tell you? Thirty seconds of rest between each set to let the muscle recover and your motor neurons to prepare themselves for the upcoming load," Rianna orated.

"But I'm perfectly fine and ready for the next set-" Kili started, but was immediately silenced with a low growl.

"Stick to the process," Rianna reiterated. "If you deviate, then you lose everything!"

Kili flinched at Rianna's forceful retort. She then nodded with a resolute expression and started to stretch her back muscles, awaiting the time to start her next set.

"Do you really have to be so strict?" Shay-Hade whispered.

"You weren't here, so you missed it," Rianna said.

"Rules and regularity," Jean declared as she rapped the blackboard behind her which had the two words written in all capital and bold typeface.

"The hell is that supposed to mean?" Rianna snapped back. She was sitting on a seat that was way too small for her size. "And why are we in this tiny classroom?"

"This was the only one available on short notice! The kindergarteners from the village finish early," Jean answered. "Now focus!"

"There's literally only two words to focus on!" Rianna argued. "Get on with it."

"Actions have consequences," Jean started. "That is a known fact. But how do you know that action A has consequence A? What if it was consequence B from an action B that occured some time back?"

Rianna raised a hand and said, "You lost me."

"I just started!" Jean exclaimed.

"Try again," Rianna dismissed with an annoyed growl.

Jean took a long breath in to calm down the bubbling anger and let it all out in one long exhale. "When you were young, were you ever told not to swim after eating?"

"Yeah, or else you'd get cramps," Rianna responded.

"I bet you did it anyways, right?" Jean asked rhetorically. "You ended up getting cramps and realised that, 'Hey, maybe rules are there for a reason?'"

Jean let the words settle before continuing, "You see, rules are built upon reasoning"

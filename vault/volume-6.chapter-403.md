Guy was suddenly crumpled in pain, as he suddenly felt as though he was being torn asunder from the inside. His mind went blank and his body went limp as everything started to shut down. It was overwhelming. For just a fraction of a second, Guy recognised the feeling. He'd felt it before, years back in fact.

To confirm his suspicion, a voice that had been missing from his life for a while now resonated in his mind.

(Guy,) Mast greeted, but Guy could not respond. The pain was far too much. (Let me help you with that.)

And suddenly, like switchin off alight, the pain just stopped. In fact, Guy couldn't feel anything anymore. He was no longer inside his body either. He felt himself getting shoved down a very narrow tube, with a heavy suction on the other end pulling him somewhere.

A few moments later, Guy was deposited in his favourite void - the place between worlds where he arrived between his transmigration and death. Now, though, he existed in this place as an ethereal copy of his current form, while Mast appeared as a basketball-sized, purple wisp floating by his side.

"Long time, no see," Guy said with a sarcastic drawl.

(Has it?) Mast responded. (Time doesn't work the same way for my kind.)

"I hope that wasn't a joke," Guy snapped back.

(We don't do that,) Mast waved of blankly.

Guy averted his attention from the purple wisp and was surprised to notice a much larger, metallic blue wisp some distance away undulating erratically.

"What's that?"

(That's the being who created the world you are inhabiting right now,) Mast answered. (You can call him Tron.)

"Why's he much larger than you?"

(Size as a dimensionality is a relative construct for our kind,) Mast answered cryptically.

"Enough with this!" Guy yelled in exasperation. "What gives, Mast? You ghost me for months on end, and suddenly this! What the hell is even going on?!"

Mast's form quivered for a few cycles before he said, (Tron's first world has succumbed to the invader.)

Guy's brows furrowed as he digested that information. "I'm... sorry..."

(Why do you apologise? It wasn't you who caused it.)

"I know... but it has still got to hurt. I mean, it's almost like someone just destroyed a part of your lifeblood, right?" Guy explained.

(It's part of the natural ecosystem,) Mast responded. (Just like prey and predators coexist in the wild. Original and Parasitic world builders are also part of a similar cycle.)

"Why am I here?" Guy asked.

(You will know. But first, we must wait for the other participant,) Mast commented.

"You don't mean-"

"What in the world was that?!" A long forgotten voice yelled as another ethereal form materialised in the void. It was a man whose appearance could be the visual definition of the word handsome. His chiselled face, toned yet lean body, voluminously flowing hair... Guy literally could fill multiple paragraphs describing the man's top-class looks.

{Stop whining!} A pink wisp by the man's side hollered. Unlike Mast's usually detached tone, this one carried a clear tinge of annoyance.

"Stupid syst-"

{For the last time, I'm not a 'system'!} The wisp emphasised before floating away from the man.

"Who-" The man pointed at Guy and tilted his head in ponderance. "Have we met before? I feel like we've met before."

"We have," Guy accepted with a sigh.

"Why can't I remember your name?" The man murmured. "Wait-"

[The connection to my previous world is lost,] the large blue wisp expressed tiredly. [Oh, it seems that everyone is here already. Hello, Guy Larks and Wei Zao. I believe those are your designations.]

"Guy Larks?" Wei Zao reiterated in confusion. "Where have I heard that name before?"

[It was brought to my attention recently that my two associates here had smuggled in a soul from each of their worlds. Have they informed you of the reason for their actions?]

Guy nodded, but Wei Zao simple said, "Wasn't it just a gift of a second life?"

{I didn't explain to him,} the pink wisp spoke up. {This one's extremely annoying to talk to.}

[On the contrary,] the blue wisp addressed Wei Zao directly. [They had another motive in bringing you two here. Though I don't compute the efficacy of that decision since two foreign souls are inconsequential in the grand tapestry of causality.]

"WAIT!" Wei Zao interrupted. "Y-You're the other guy! I knew there had to be another one. The Printing Press, the influx of modern inventions flooding the market. It was you, wasn't it?!"

"I don't know what you're talking about," Guy answered evasively.

"Don't give me that bullshit! You-"

[I am a world builder,] the blue wisp continued, silencing Wei Zao in the process. [We are beings who literally build the worlds that souls inhabit and maintain them. The world you live in right now was built by me. The one's you came from are built by Mast and Moni respectively. While these two only manage one world each, I happen to manage two. However, my first world has been parasitised and wholly consumed by another world builder of the parasitic order.]

"What is all this?" Wei Zao blurted out. "Sys- I guess your name is Moni. What the heck is going on?"

{Just shut up for once and listen!} Moni chided.

"That's easy for you to say. I've literally been pulled into what feels like a plot way above my paygrade and I don't even understand a nineth of what is being said," Wei Zao complained.

[I believe a visual display will be of assistance here,] Tron stated before the void gained dimensionality and stars started to dot the scene. The surroundings turned into the vast emptiness of space, serene yet suffocating.

All of a sudden, the scene started to warp and the dotted stars started to blur as though they were entering lightspeed.

[The inhabitants of my previous world made it quite far in terms of understanding the rules I set in building it,] Trons voice echoed all around them. [The races had all set for the stars, and were able to travel between planets nigh-instantaneously through warp travel.]

Guy found himself hurled out of lightspeed and deposited before a chaotic scene.

Into the distance, he saw a supermassive black hole tearing through the fabric of reality. And from within that tear, extended thick tentacles of green, red, pink and purple. The green tentacles were slimy, the red with thorny, the pink were veiny, and the purple were luminescent. These tentacles extended far and wide, embedding themselves deep into the planets all around the black hole. On these impaled planets walked nonsensical creatures of green, red, pink and purple.

His attention was zoomed outwards, and Guy realised that this was not the only occurence as there was a similar scene occuring in every other galaxy in this universe. What also caught his attention was the large wars and battles were constantly being faught in these contested planets. The world was literally in the verge of destruction.

[My world was invaded through these natural tears in spacetime that are commonplace in every world,] Tron explained. [Black holes, as they are called, are necessary puzzle pieces in every stable world. But they are also a source of vulnerability. The invader used this vulnerability and planted a seed in them. Every vibrant soul that died in vicinity of these tears was sucked into them instead of being routed through me. When enough souls accumulated in the tears, it then formed sentient amalgam entities. Over time, four entities became most prominent and managed to extend their influence outside the tear in spacetime through the same way you managed to enter my new world, possession. They enticed native creatures of my world to lower their guard and took control. Little by little they invaded society and wreaked havoc. The worst part is that any entity killed by a spawn or possession from the tear in spacetime gets routed back into the tear and to the invader.]

"What about this world?" Guy asked.

[I have taken precautions. The spacetime tears of this world are more... reinforced. In fact, most supermassive tears are inhabited by a creature of the void of my own design,] Tron explained.

"That's guided creation, right? I thought world creators were all about nudging development in a positive direction, and not about taking full control of it?" Guy probed.

[It took a lot of effort from my side to make it happen. But I deemed it necessary. I don't want a repeat of my previous world, of course,] Tron answered matter-of-factly.

"These creatures of the void," Wei Zao cut in. "What do they look like?"

[They look like madness,] Tron answered curtly.

"What does madness look like?" Wei Zao continued.

[Madness looks like madness,] Tron reiterated.

"It feels like you don't understand the question-"

{Just shut up and listen!} Moni reprimanded.

[What you are observing in this visual is the world getting sucked dry of all vibrance,] Tron stated, and the scene started to fast-forward. Planets were getting dessicated while the tentacles extended further outwards, growing to a point of engulfing galaxies in their whole. Creatures kept dying and more and more nonsense entities of green, red, pink and purple started to populate the world.

[At this point, the entire world is the parasite's,] Tron stated. [Since they don't have a world of their own to sustain them, they will bleed this world for all that it is worth and then move on. And because my second world is searchable by tracking down my signature, it is only an eventuality for my new world to be on the parasite's crosshairs].

[In fact, there is nothing that can stop the invader from finding and attacked my world. I can build protections and countermeasures, but seeing how effectively he dismantled my first struggle, it is clear that the attacker is far more experienced and stronger than I. This world is going to succumb too-]

(And when it does, mine and Moni's world will soon follow. We borrowed a lot from Tron when building our worlds. Because of that, there is a route that exists that leads right to our worlds.)

{And we aren't so experienced so as to put up a fight against the attacker like Tron. If the parasite hits us, we will give up immediately,} Moni interjected. {The fate of this world and your original worlds hangs in the balance.}

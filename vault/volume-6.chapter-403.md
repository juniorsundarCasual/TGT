Guy was suddenly crumpled in pain, as he suddenly felt as though he was being torn asunder from the inside. His mind went blank and his body went limp as everything started to shut down. It was overwhelming. For just a fraction of a second, Guy recognised the feeling. He'd felt it before, years back in fact.

To confirm his suspicion, a voice that had been missing from his life for a while now resonated in his mind.

(Guy,) Mast greeted, but Guy could not respond. The pain was far too much. (Let me help you with that.)

And suddenly, like switchin off alight, the pain just stopped. In fact, Guy couldn't feel anything anymore. He was no longer inside his body either. He felt himself getting shoved down a very narrow tube, with a heavy suction on the other end pulling him somewhere.

A few moments later, Guy was deposited in his favourite void - the place between worlds where he arrived between his transmigration and death. Now, though, he existed in this place as an ethereal copy of his current form, while Mast appeared as a basketball-sized, purple wisp floating by his side.

"Long time, no see," Guy said with a sarcastic drawl.

(Has it?) Mast responded. (Time doesn't work the same way for my kind.)

"I hope that wasn't a joke," Guy snapped back.

(We don't do that,) Mast waved of blankly.

Guy averted his attention from the purple wisp and was surprised to notice a much larger, metallic blue wisp some distance away undulating erratically.

"What's that?"

(That's the being who created the world you are inhabiting right now,) Mast answered. (You can call him Tron.)

"Why's he much larger than you?"

(Size as a dimensionality is a relative construct for our kind,) Mast answered cryptically.

"Enough with this!" Guy yelled in exasperation. "What gives, Mast? You ghost me for months on end, and suddenly this! What the hell is even going on?!"

Mast's form quivered for a few cycles before he said, (Tron's first world has succumbed to the invader.)

Guy's brows furrowed as he digested that information. "I'm... sorry..."

(Why do you apologise? It wasn't you who caused it.)

"I know... but it has still got to hurt. I mean, it's almost like someone just destroyed a part of your lifeblood, right?" Guy explained.

(It's part of the natural ecosystem,) Mast responded. (Just like prey and predators coexist in the wild. Original and Parasitic world builders are also part of a similar cycle.)

"Why am I here?" Guy asked.

(You will know. But first, we must wait for the other participant,) Mast commented.

"You don't mean-"

"What in the world was that?!" A long forgotten voice yelled as another ethereal form materialised in the void. It was a man whose appearance could be the visual definition of the word handsome. His chiselled face, toned yet lean body, voluminously flowing hair... Guy literally could fill multiple paragraphs describing the man's top-class looks.

{Stop whining!} A pink wisp by the man's side hollered. Unlike Mast's usually detached tone, this one carried a clear tinge of annoyance.

"Stupid syst-"

{For the last time, I'm not a 'system'!} The wisp emphasised before floating away from the man.

"Who-" The man pointed at Guy and tilted his head in ponderance. "Have we met before? I feel like we've met before."

"We have," Guy accepted with a sigh.

"Why can't I remember your name?" The man murmured. "Wait-"

[The connection to my previous world is lost,] the large blue wisp expressed tiredly. [Oh, it seems that everyone is here already. Hello, Guy Larks and Wei Zao. I believe those are your designations.]

"Guy Larks?" Wei Zao reiterated in confusion. "Where have I heard that name before?"

[It was brought to my attention recently that my two associates here had smuggled in a soul from each of their worlds. Have they informed you of the reason for their actions?]

Guy nodded, but Wei Zao simple said, "Wasn't it just a gift of a second life?"

{I didn't explain to him,} the pink wisp spoke up. {This one's extremely annoying to talk to.}

[On the contrary,] the blue wisp addressed Wei Zao directly. [They had another motive in bringing you two here. Though I don't compute the efficacy of that decision since two foreign souls are inconsequential in the grand tapestry of causality.]

"WAIT!" Wei Zao interrupted. "Y-You're the other guy! I knew there had to be another one. The Printing Press, the influx of modern inventions flooding the market. It was you, wasn't it?!"

"I don't know what you're talking about," Guy answered evasively.

"Don't give me that bullshit! You-"

[I am a world builder,] the blue wisp continued, silencing Wei Zao in the process. [We are beings who literally build the worlds that souls inhabit and maintain them. The world you live in right now was built by me. The one's you came from are built by Mast and Moni respectively. While these two only manage one world each, I happen to manage two. However, my first world has been parasitised and wholly consumed by another world builder of the parasitic order.]

"What is all this?" Wei Zao blurted out. "Sys- I guess your name is Moni. What the heck is going on?"

{Just shut up for once and listen!} Moni chided.

"That's easy for you to say. I've literally been pulled into what feels like a plot way above my paygrade and I don't even understand a nineth of what is being said," Wei Zao complained.

[I believe a visual display will be of assistance here,] Tron stated before the void gained dimensionality and stars started to dot the scene.



OC calls everyone to attention and raises the point that he was aware of their existence in his world.

He then tells of the end his previous world faced displaying a glimpse of the years the preceded the complete annihalation.

- space faring world with lots of mechs and lucrehulk-class battleships with posthumans, aliens and whatnot
- invading force is warp entity similar to how it is in W40k

Guy points out the simliarity to that IP, OC says that probabilistically, every dream a person has ever had exists out there in the infinite tapestry of worlds.

OC talks about how the invader is a parasite. He is known to have destroyed over ten worlds, which is a lot.

All OC knows is that the nature of the attack is never similar in theme, but the process is common. To slowly pull the entities originally in the source world into the parasite world and having them die there so that their souls gets pulled out of circulation. This way the source world will become exhausted of world energy.

He then says that his world will soon succumb even though he is trying his best to stop the invasion. The other wisps say that once that happens their world will follow.

Wei Zao bursts out saying that they will beat them.

OC says that it is impossible. He is fighting against a world not another entity, and that hubris will be his downfall.

He then says that he is willing to entertain the experiment going on. Since although the world is doomed to death, a fraction of a fraction of a probability exists that the world can be saved with their intervention. He says they can go on doing all they want knowing what exists at the finish line.

He then warns them that the invasion can occur at any time, tomorrow or even centuries later, as time is not a state of existence for World Creators.

Wei Zao proposes an alliance with Guy, saying that he is aware of Guy's presence at the True World Sect.

Guy responds likewise saying that he knows of Teacher Jo Way, and that they used to be acquaintances at the Radiant Academy, causing Wei Zao to sputter in shock.

Guy takes a moment to ponder and then recognises that an alliance would be suitable.

The duo are then ejected back into their bodies.

Guy looks up and sees a world tear hitting the woods.

Grace exclaims that the kids are there.

Shuri's eyelids drooped as she watched the Sect Leader leave her room. She was truly out of energy, and her body gave way immediately after - she collapsed back into her mattress and entered a deep slumber that was free of uneasiness and pain.

A cat never enters deep sleep, unless it is completely certain that its environment is free of any threats or natural predators. It is their natural instinct. Shuri also adhered to this principle throughout her life. Although she was the only dweller in her courtyard at the Inner Palace, she never truly felt safe there. Her sleep was always incremental and light.

When Shuri woke up eight hours later, she realised that she felt safer in this cramped up room (in comparison to her previous accommodation) with so many others living nearby, than she did back at the Palace! Sure, in the beginning here, her sleep was shallow due to her inherent distrust. But as time passed her guard had lowered little by little, until she grew so comfortable that she didn't think twice before closing her eyes at night. Heck! She even left her room unlocked overnight sometimes!

"Maybe it's time to just admit it," Shuri said with a bitter chuckle. "There is nothing to criticise, nothing to question, nothing that signals any sort of problem stopping me from assimilating into this Sect."

At this point, anything she could formulate through some heavy mental gymnastics would just be an excuse - an excuse to run away, to isolate herself from the world.

Just then, she started to recollect everything that transpired last night. Although her mind was addled, her senses weren't completely defunct. She could clearly remember the conversations, the events, and even the words spoken by Sect Leader Larks. The overwhelming bout of weakness back then had caused a wave of panic to drown Shuri, but the calm voice of Sect Leader Larks and Matron Reva calmed her down. It was unusual - the feeling of relief and comfort from being cared for by someone else. Shuri didn't feel any ulterior motive in their actions - well, her convoluted mind did create a few scenarios but her rationality quickly discarded them because she realised that maybe her paranoia was quite excessive.

Maybe... Sect Leader Larks was right. "What is there to lose from giving the Sect another chance?"

Shuri could not openly admit that, "the Sect is pretty safe."

A wave of relief washed over Shuri when she said those words out loud. If she wasn't being smothered by the heavy comforter, Shuri feared she would float away and disappear into the blue sky.

Shuri lay in bed for a while longer and allowed her usually rampant mind to calm down. She got up a few minutes later and cycled through a few Yoga poses, allowing calmness to seep into every nook and corner of her body. Then, for the first time in her life, she skipped out her room towards the mess hall.

It was nearing the end of breakfast, so she only managed to secure some cold fried eggs and bread, but she ate it with relish. Classes would start soon, but Shuri didn't have to sit in any ways. At this point, she could follow Sect Leader Larks' instructions and visit his office directly. But Shuri decided to do something else... something ill-advised.

She turned down a familiar path and followed it to the recreation room. She pushed through the doors and followed down a corridor to where she usually reported her daily assignments to Marie. Upon reaching there she was unsurprised to find her target seated in the same location leafing through papers and noting things down as she did so. But she WAS surprised to find another individual seated next to her.

"You don't have to sit next to me while I work, Master," Marie groaned.

"Ha! I've left you to your devices long enough, girl," Mage Nara responded sternly. "You're overextending the use of your powers. The future isn't your playground to mess around with."

"I'm doing it for the good of the Sect and its members," Marie argued.

"That's not for you to decide," Mage Nara growled. "Freedom of choice and self-determination is what keeps the world running. It's contradictory when you think about the implications of fate in the grand scheme of things. But if you snatch the illusion of choice away from people, they devolve into behaviours that are antithetical to their inner character. That's when things start going out of control."

"Did Mister Larks complain...?" Marie probed with a low voice.

"He didn't need to. I can hear just fine," Mage Nara scoffed. "I've had my eye on you since I accepted you as my Disciple."

"That is a massive invasion of privacy," Marie yelled back while pulling her jacket to cover herself.

"Oh please!" Mage Nara retorted as he stood up. "I don't have such juvenile and downright immoral proclivities. I just needed to make sure you weren't doing anything stupid."

Picking up his walking stick, he said, "Now, if you will excuse me, you have a visitor."

As Mage Nara walked away, Marie yelled, "Just stay here, why don't you? I know you're going to listen in on this conversation anyway."

"I don't need to listen in on this conversation because I already know what this conversation is going to be about, smartass," Mage Nara shot back. As he left, he gave Shuri a nod of greeting.

"Stop hiding behind the shelf and come over, Shuri," Marie beckoned. "If I'm not mistaken, you should be relieved from your commitment with me. So what brings you here?"

"As Mage Nara just said, you should already know," Shuri responded with a smug smile.

Marie sighed loudly and said, "I hope you know just how dumb that sounds. If you don't speak, this conversation will never happen. And if it never happens, I will never know..."

"I was only joking," Shuri retorted while waving her hands.

"Oh? You do that now?" Marie emphasised with a faint smile. "You still haven't answered my question."

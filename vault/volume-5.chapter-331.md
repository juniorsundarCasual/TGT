A famous man once said, "insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results."

Interestingly, if you replace the word 'expecting' with 'hoping for', you'd actually be defining patience. However, an insane person will keep repeating the task with the same level of enthusiasm as the very first time. A patient person will eventually lose the 'hope' driving them onwards.

Two whole months had passed since Jean arrived at this place. Two whole months of repeating the same thing over and over (and over ad infinitum simile), and expecting different results. Everyday, Jean would repopulate microbes, pit her microbes against the Plague, evaluate the performance of the population, crossover to create a new population, mutate a portion of the population, rinse and repeat until she'd exhaust her mana core for the day. During the first month, the changes were more visible. She could see that her process was directing her microbes to the solution she wanted (something that could fight against the Plague).

But then, midway through the second month, she stumbled upon one a problem - convergence. She found that her solution had reached a convergent point and each consecutive generation was only incrementing performance by a negligible percentage at best. This is usually an indication that a solution has been reached, and it is time for the genetic algorithm to terminate. However, the problem was that the generation of microbes didn't really match Jean's expectation. Although they could now hold out against the Plague, they could not destroy it. Essentially, it would be like a vaccination not a total immunisation, which Jean later tested by finding a test rodent and loading it with the microbes from the convergence generation and sending it into the infected territory. Of course, this was after running sufficient due diligence, since Jean's restrictions could let her hurt anything (knowingly). And wouldn't you know it, the rodent survived!

Yet this wasn't enough! Now, if any mage were to hear Jean's thoughts, they would unquestionably throttle Jean and then kill themselves in a place murder-suicide wrought of anger and disgrace, over the fact that a girl a fraction of their age had accomplished something they couldn't with all their infinite wisdom that too in an even smaller fraction of the time. One should know that the Plague had been on the Empire's, Sect Alliance's and the Teacher's Co-operative's docket for years, and none of the groups had made any headway.

Jean, though, was feeling annoyed over the fact that her progress had hit a plateau. She couldn't settle for just a partial solution, knowing that there was potential for more. But the problem was that she didn't know just what was missing. She first thought that this was a local maximum. To test if this was the case, she decided to follow through with some of the solutions written in the "Evolutionary Algorithms" text. First was to increase diversity of the population, by adding more variations and increasing the mutation rate. This did destabilise the solution for a few generations. Yet after a few more days, the solution converged to the earlier one. She even implemented a few variations in the crossover and propagation criteria, but none of them worked. At this point, Jean didn't have the motivation to restart the process. First off, she didn't have the heart to scrap over a month of progress. Secondly, she was certain that even restarting wouldn't make a difference.

The limitation, in fact, with the microbes at her disposal. There was only so much an upstart brute force method could solve - it wasn't enough to bridge the gap between a Foundation Establishment realm fledgling mage with a veteran Core Formation realm one. This was when Jean truly realised her limitation, and the fact that she was truly in over her head.

Of course, something did come out of the practise in tedium. After internalising the make-up of her most recent generation of microbes, Jean was able to condense a massive portion of her knowledge about diseases within her cultivation. The insight gained from breaking down the mechanism of her optimised microbes was staggering, and it pushed her close to breaking through by a minor realm. In fact, the microbes at her disposal had the potential to be a universal vaccine.

Nonetheless, this victory felt consolatory in Jean's eyes. She hadn't achieved what she set out to do initially, and that bugged her to no end. This also brought on the second problem - the temptation. Having reached so close to the end, yet being separated by a seemingly vast canyon, Jean was suddenly egged by the temptation to take the "easy path".

Mister Larks once said, "There is no shame in asking for help, especially when you are stuck! Pride and ego gets you nothing but disappointment and dissatisfaction. Put those two aside, and you have a more welcoming world at your disposal."

Jean, of course, wasn't dragged down by arrogance, pride or ego. It was the fact that the help wouldn't actually be for a contribution of expertise or wisdom, but a sacrifice. That too, a sacrifice from a minor who trusted her - believed in her. Kili's blood was the remaining piece of the puzzle - more specifically the antibodies coursing through them.

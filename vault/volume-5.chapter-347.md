"I can't say that I'm not a little bit jealous," Markus said as he walked alongside Shuri to the Sect Leader's office. "But my pride seems to overshadow that. I guess this is how it feels when a student surpasses the teacher?"

Shuri snorted mockingly and said, "That's just you, Senior Brother Reva."

Then after a pause, she added, "Maybe others in this Sect as well. You won't find such benevolence in educators outside the Sect. I've seen Teacher's sabotaging their Students for petty reasons."

"That's just... disgusting!" Markus responded with a displeased look. "How can an educator betray the trust of their student like that?"

"Well, for sake of discussion, I'm going to limit myself to cultivation and magic only. For a Teacher, the performance of a Student is a sign of competence not just of the Student, but for the Teacher themselves. The better a Student is in their journey through magic, the better it reflects on the Teacher's portfolio. However-"

Shuri raised a finger and wore a morose frown. "There is a line. A line that when crossed turn all the positive social credits a Teacher earns thanks to their overachieving Student turns into poison. And you will know when that line is crossed when the comments you hear all around after a rather shining performance by the Student no longer praise the Teacher, but start questioning whether the Teacher is required in the first place?"

"If the Teacher's ego is so fragile, they shouldn't be taking on the responsibility in the first place!" Markus responded with a sickened frown.

"You don't become a Teacher because you can teach," Shuri commented with a bitter chuckle. "You become a Teacher because you know more than the other person in the room - not a conducive personality trait you want in an educator."

"No kidding..." Markus affirmed.

"Besides, I don't consider you my Teacher," Shuri shot back, causing Markus to turn around with a raised brow. "We're collaborators, you just had a head start."

Markus let out an uproarious laugh and patted Shuri on the back good-naturedly, "That's for sure, partner!"

"What are you two doing here?" A familiar voice interrupted the duo just as they turned the corner and reached the Sect Leader's office door.

"That wasn't a question I expected to hear from you, Marie," Markus responded with a sarcastic snigger.

"Funny," Marie responded with an equal level of sarcasm oozing in her voice. "Master's been riding my ass extra hard nowadays; I'm not allowed to use the Heavenly Eye for a while."

"Y-Yes," the word just rolled off of Revian's tongue without hesitation.

The Sect Leader leaned forward and asked with sparkling eyes, "Why?"

"Umm, 'Why' What?"

"Why do you want to join our Sect? Your arrival here wasn't happenstance - your feet didn't carry you here, your brain did. So tell me..."

"Revian," he said noticing the Sect Leader's expectant expression. The man smiled and continued.

"Mister Revian. Tell me, why do you want to be a part of our Sect?" He asked while approaching Revian's position.

"I... don't know. I mean, you offered-"

"Let me rephrase the question, why do you want to join a sect at all?" The Sect Leader closed the distance between them even further. Revian felt the world receding, the only voices that remained were his own and the man's.

"I want to become a mage,"

"Why?"

Again with the 'why's. It was starting to irk Revian. Even though the words were the same, he could feel a growing sense of pressure urging him to answer truthfully.

"Its..." The Sect Leader's gaze bore down on him.

"Its..." The pressure grew more intense. Revian couldn't take it any longer.

"It's because I don't want to be mediocre anymore!"

"You think that magic will let you escape mediocrity?" The Sect Leader asked with cocked brows. "How so?"

"Well... It's something," Revian reasoned with dismayed and drooping shoulders. "I don't know what to say."

"You believe that with the powers of a mage, your life will suddenly become something different, something extraordinary. So let us assume that you've now reached that point. The powers you dreamed of are in your grasp, what will you do now?"

"What do you mean?"

"It was you who professed that magic would elevate you from your current life of mediocrity. Now that you have magic, how will your life be any different?"

"As a mage I can do whatever I want," Revian declared haphazardly. "I-I won't have to grovel, beg and bow in front of others anymore. If there is something I want, I have the power to fight for it and take it."

"Once you become a mage, your competition is no longer against the regular folk, because you aren't technically even the same species. By acting the way you just described, you would be bullying the weak. Is that the kind of person you wish to be as a mage?"

"I don't... But then..." Revian was starved for words. Being forced to evaluate his actions and decisions of the last four years with a rational lens really put things into perspective. 'Why am I even going through with all of this?'

He held back his palms from slapping his forehead in embarrassment. He was just making a fool out of himself now.

"I think I'm going to go now," Revian declared as he turned to leave.

"I do agree with your assumption that magic will raise you from your life of ordinariness. But I think there is a better way to go about achieving it that using said magic as an avenue to suppress the nay-sayers," The Sect Leader said, causing Revian's feet to halt. Something about the way he spoke just made Revian want to listen.

"Magic carries with it an unimaginable amount of power. This power is intoxicating like alcohol - it will make you feel like you're at the top of the world!" The man's expression grew animated and a trace bit fanatical. "Just like alcohol, an overabundance of this exhilarating feeling can degenerate you. It rots you from within."

"There is an ancient saying that 'with great power, comes great responsibility'. If you have the power to enact change in a more meaningful sense, then it is our responsibility to do so," The man said as he spoke in a whisper that somehow resonated in Revian's mind.

"This is where, I believe, you will find the escape route from your mundane life. You can still learn magic and work to become a mage, but instead of channelling your powers towards hate, suppression and destruction, you can dedicate it for something more productive and constructive. I can promise you that it will be more fulfilling and exciting. Besides-"

The Sect Leader leaned back and crossed his arms. A faint smile grazed his lips as they parted with a conclusion, "The fame gained from helping others is far more valuable and long-lasting that the infamy foisted upon you from causing pain."

Revian's mind blanked out at this point. His preconceived thoughts were being rewritten, as he underwent a shift in thought at a deep level.

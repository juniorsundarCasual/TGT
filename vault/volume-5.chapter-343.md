"Amazing! Absolutely amazing!"

Sect Leader Larks did not hold back his praise as he used the mana core calculator created by Shuri. His expression was frozen in awe and wonder, as well as childlike amusement as he tested out the device with glee. The duo were currently in the Sect Leader's office.

"Although I know the answer already, I just have to ask how you accomplished this?" The Sect Leader inquired while continuing his vivacious inspection. "You don't have to answer... I get it... confidentiality and all that. I never thought I'd get to see an actual, functioning, digital calculator in this lifetime!"

Shuri scratched her head embarrassedly and said, "I applied what you taught me about logic gates, and used it to augment the knowledge I already had about Automagy. The result is what you see before you."

The Sect Leader lowered the ball in his hand and gave Shuri an appreciative thumbs-up. "You know this is why I adore all you children. To be able to see possibilities and connections that adults like me miss. Who'd have though that Automagy could have such applications- I mean, I could have guessed, but it would have been only a half-informed reach at best."

"Anyway," the Sect Leader interrupted his own rambling and stated, "This device... I can see it being very useful in the hands of people working extensively with numbers on a regular basis. Take your Senior Sister Marie for example. Back when she used to work with caravans as an accountant, she would have killed to have something useful like this making her life easier."

"I agree," Shuri said while humming contemplatively.

"So, what do you wish to do with your creation?" The Sect Leader probed.

"I wish to register a patent for this device," Shuri responded decisively, causing the Sect Leader's brows to raise in surprise.

"You do realise that in doing so, you will be revealing the technique to the Sect?" The man reminded.

"I don't mind," Shuri responded while revealing a satisfied smile. "This work is far detached enough, and original enough, to not draw comparison with any existing works or techniques."

The two exchanged a meaningful look before simultaneously nodding in the affirmative.

"I also wish to add this product into the VTC's (Verum Trading Company) portfolio," Shuri declared conclusively.

In response to that, the man's brows jumped even higher (threatening to jump off his forehead and shooting into the sky). "T-That's admirable. What is the lead time to produce this calculator?"

"It took me an hour and a half to program the mana core. I can make it faster through some practise and optimsation of the circuitry," Shuri answered. "But the throttle is actually on the rate at which the inert cores are being farmed. I cannot extract more than six inert cores in one go, lest it affects the quality of the cores."

"Would having more people working with you to extract the cores be of any help?" The Sect Leader suggested.

"It would," Shuri said. "The rate at which the mana sink produces wisps and slimes allows the extraction of up to 25 mana cores in one day before we start hitting a net loss. However-"

At that point, the Sect Leader interjected and finished Shuri's sentence for her, "-However, you will have to share you methods with other people, and since you said that the technique you're employing is proprietary and deeply tied to your family, it would raise red flags if it somehow leaks."

Shuri affirmed Sect Leader Larks' guess with a bitter smile and nod.

"What if we try other strategies?" The Sect Leader proposed. "I mean, you managed to derive an original interpretation to programming a mana core. I know its asking for a lot - like asking lightning to strike the same place again - but maybe we could develop a core farming method of our own as well?"

Shuri bobbed her head in thought as she considered the idea. "It would take a lot of time, and resources to research that problem. And to be honest, I don't feel like taking on that task at the moment. I mean, the calculator doesn't NEED to be ubiquitous just yet. A mana core IS scarce resource, it wouldn't do us any good to flood the market with this product."

"You make a good point. I guess I got ahead of myself there," the Sect Leader doubled back while scratching his head embarrassedly. At that moment, the door to the office resounded with three knocks in a peculiar pattern. A smile flashed past the Sect Leader's face, which he quickly hid amidst a clearly fake coughing fit.

"Let us put a pin on this discussion for now. Why don't you take the rest of the day off and relax? Seeing as you've just advanced, you deserve some time to consolidate your cultivation," the Sect Leader said with a serious expression. He tapped his desk with his fingers frantically before adding, "Oh! Make sure to drop by the mess hall. I know you've missed your meals again. I'd rather not have to explain this situation to Grace again, it is quite embarrassing, I'm not going to lie."

Shuri chuckled at the Sect Leader's words before she rose, bowed, and left the office.

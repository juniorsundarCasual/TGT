Although Markus had access to all the information he could ever need regarding the fundamental force known as gravity, he was struggling to make much headway into applying it in a more offensive capacity.

There was an extremely narrow bottleneck he was experiencing, one that he did not face when trying to weaponise other more primitive attacks like with fire, water, air or earth. Even using electricity was becoming manageable after he determined how to quickly ionise air particles to allow a rapid pathway for discharge.

Gravity was a whole other ball game. It didn't operate in a way that made sense. Sure, simplifying it to 'mass gets pulled closer' makes it easier to understand. However, that superficial definition only takes you so far before you're forced to undergo a paradigm shift and literally relearn the whole thing all over again.

To be honest, Jean had it much worse since she had to first learn that there is the smallest divisible state of any matter beyond which it loses all of its properties - molecules. And that below that divisible state exist the fundamental building blocks of all things - atoms. And that atoms are made up of even smaller particles - protons, neutrons and electron. AND, after internalising these concepts, she had to relearn how these molecules, atoms and subatomic particles behaved and interacted with each other. 

Nowadays, Markus had learned to pace himself. Before, he always felt this heavy pressure of time bearing down on him - this gnawing feeling of powerlessness urging him to push past his limits. But it was starting to become clear to him that no matter what obstruction he faced, it could easily be overcome with diligence and effort. It was how he got this far, after all!

Just like he predicted, after weeks of diligent research work and tests, something did bear fruit. Basically, Markus relied on making minor shifts in the gravitational forces acting on an individual or object to disrupt their movement. He could only sustain it for a small time-frame because doing it for longer drained him off a lot of mana. This usually implied that the method was not efficient or in other words wasn't "close enough to the truth".

What inspired him to reevaluate things was the concept of conservation. One of the fundamental laws of physics is that in every interaction, energy is always conserved - what goes in is what comes out. When Markus brought this this theory into his problem, it opened his eyes up to the fact that when he shifted the gravity of a point he wasn't strictly adhering to the conservation laws.

Gravity is proven to be a conservative force. Basically, if you start from one point on an object's gravitational field and move to another point, regardless of which pathway you take, you should expend the same amount of mechanical energy. In artificially increasing or decreasing the gravity in one location, Markus was violating this law and was thus being forced to expend a much larger quantity of mana to support it.

The solution to the problem was simple... on paper. In truth, it involved a lot of mathematics, and Markus sorely wished Marie was there to help him navigate through that mire. Deriving a theorem that worked took him a few days of scribbling, scrapping and editing. Applying the theorem into a spell that works took him a whole month, even with a lot of assistance from his Master.

The outcome was as follows. Designate a spherical region around himself. Within this region, he could modulate the gravitational field however he wished as long as moving from any point on the sphere's periphery to another point on its periphery expended the same mount of mechanical energy. Ultimately it was a balancing act. Markus could increase the gravitational field strength at one point in the region as long as he offset it by decreasing it across another. The problem was doing this quickly. He had to both rely on the mana refined by his core and a plethora of spell circles to activate the spell. All of this had to be achieved in combat. Furthermore, although there was a sharp reduction in mana consumed to sustain the spell, it still left him drained when utilised for a long time period. Finally, the designated spherical region could not be moved once established. This was because activating the spell required excessive mathematical calculations in the backend, and changing the region would warrant a recalculation.

Markus named this new attack, |Gravity Field|. He never thought he would get the opportunity to debut it so publicly. He never thought the spell would be so brutal either - he was close enough to physically hear a few of his opponent's bones shatter.

But like he said to his Master, it was necessary. The True World Sect needed to show its strength, even briefly. A tall tree must bear the brunt of a heavy storm, but one that doesn't rise to meet the canopy will wither away without sunlight.

"That was far too close for comfort. Your mana reserves were nearly empty!" Jean scolded with an imperceptible edge to her voice.

Dora flew backwards as the floor beneath her turned solid-liquid almost immediately. As she was carried towards the gaping black maws that came as tears in space itself, she observed Fancy turning direction mid-air and diving straight towards her. Dora finger tips wrapped around Fancy's extended front limb, but Fancy's struggles to escape the unrelenting suction from the void beyond the tear was pointless. They were caught.

Luckily, she wasn't alone in her disorienting journey through the maddening warp unlike her brother. Fancy wrapped her wings around Dora and the two individuals held on in a tight embrace. They spun, twisted and tilted continuously, not knowing which side was up and which side was down. It felt like being thrusted through a very narrow tunnel undergoing peristalsis.

Dora tried to scream and shout, but the voice that left her throat did not leave her lips, nor did she hear anything in return. It was the first time in her life she heard true, and complete, silence. There were no tiny chatter of insects, nor was there the near imperceptible bumbling of birds echoing in the wind. She would have loved to dwell in this serenity and peace if not for the utter uncertainty she was drowning in.

The only reason she wasn't panicking was that she was gracefully nestled in Fancy's embrace. The faint heat emanating from the cold-blooded insect was like the warmth from the comforting sun when compared against the emotional and physical coldness in the vast void she was hurtling through. But as time progressed, or didn't, the forgotten panic was starting to inch in. Closer, and closer.

But then suddenly, a bright dot of light caught Dora's eyes. She focused on it, and was delighted to learn that she was approaching it, very quickly. Within seconds, the minute dot engorged itself and swallowed the void whole. Then just as she was sucked into this darkness, the light pulled her and Fancy out.

The first thing Dora noticed wasn't the soft, dewey grass she landed on, or the fresh air that cleansed her airway, but the return of all the sound that had disappeared in the void.

The voices had returned. But they were different.

Instead of the usual cacophony of chatter with each voice talking over the other, it was... different. It was like a symphony. A graceful layering of voices and sounds, one on top of the other, but each complementing the previous one. There was an intricate call and response, no voice was unnecessary. It was like a well designed conversation with no wasted words, with aptly placed silences in between so that the senses weren't being overwhelmed at every moment.

It was serene.

But amidst this serenity, a new voice barged in like a bull in a china shop.

"Dora! Are you okay?!" Dora raised her head and observed Fancy dusting herself off and spreading her majestic wings.

"Fancy?"

Dora rushed towards the insect as she arose from the mound of dirt she had landed on. With a flap of her wings, she lifted off the ground and hovered around Dora, while her antennae started to skitter all over the little girl to ensure that nothing was off.

"Where are we?" Dora asked, ignoring the anxious and concerned insect altogether.

"I do not know," Fancy answered. "But it does not 'feel' like home."

That was putting it lightly. Because the ambience felt denser and heavier. It wasn't just the increasingly humid air that nearly suffocated her with every breath, but the fact that the trees were at least five times taller than the tallest tree she had ever seen in her entire life. She had no idea how the sunlight even made it past the dense canopy of green up above and illuminated the ground.

Suddenly, a silence fell in the area, with the only sound disturbing the eerie pause being the faint rustling of the leaves. The 'music' had just stopped. After straining her hearing further, Dora managed to hear faint chatter in the background, but it was far too low in volume to make sense of. But she also noticed that it was moving away.

"I think we scared the animals away," Dora commented. But then, as she turned to face Fancy, she noticed her companion remaining stiff with the hairs that decorated her body standing in an unusually upright angle - a clear sign of fear!

"We must hide!" Fancy warned before quickly grabbing Dora with her appendages and flying upwards. They found footing in a high enough branch that sufficiently secluded them and waited.

"Wha-"

BOOM!

The tree they were on shook

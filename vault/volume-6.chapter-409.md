Dora flew backwards as the floor beneath her turned solid-liquid almost immediately. As she was carried towards the gaping black maws that came as tears in space itself, she observed Fancy turning direction mid-air and diving straight towards her. Dora finger tips wrapped around Fancy's extended front limb, but Fancy's struggles to escape the unrelenting suction from the void beyond the tear was pointless. They were caught.

Luckily, she wasn't alone in her disorienting journey through the maddening warp unlike her brother. Fancy wrapped her wings around Dora and the two individuals held on in a tight embrace. They spun, twisted and tilted continuously, not knowing which side was up and which side was down. It felt like being thrusted through a very narrow tunnel undergoing peristalsis.

Dora tried to scream and shout, but the voice that left her throat did not leave her lips, nor did she hear anything in return. It was the first time in her life she heard true, and complete, silence. There were no tiny chatter of insects, nor was there the near imperceptible bumbling of birds echoing in the wind. She would have loved to dwell in this serenity and peace if not for the utter uncertainty she was drowning in.

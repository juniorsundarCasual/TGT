Dora flew backwards as the floor beneath her turned solid-liquid almost immediately. As she was carried towards the gaping black maws that came as tears in space itself, she observed Fancy turning direction mid-air and diving straight towards her. Dora finger tips wrapped around Fancy's extended front limb, but Fancy's struggles to escape the unrelenting suction from the void beyond the tear was pointless. They were caught.

Luckily, she wasn't alone in her disorienting journey through the maddening warp unlike her brother. Fancy wrapped her wings around Dora and the two individuals held on in a tight embrace. They spun, twisted and tilted continuously, not knowing which side was up and which side was down. It felt like being thrusted through a very narrow tunnel undergoing peristalsis.

Dora tried to scream and shout, but the voice that left her throat did not leave her lips, nor did she hear anything in return. It was the first time in her life she heard true, and complete, silence. There were no tiny chatter of insects, nor was there the near imperceptible bumbling of birds echoing in the wind.

The first thing Dora noticed wasn't the soft, dewey grass she landed on, or the fresh air that cleansed her airway, but the return of all the sound that had disappeared in the void.

The voices had returned. But they were different.

Instead of the usual cacophony of chatter with each voice talking over the other, it was... different. It was like a symphony. A graceful layering of voices and sounds, one on top of the other, but each complementing the previous one. There was an intricate call and response, no voice was unnecessary. It was like a well designed conversation with no wasted words, with aptly placed silences in between so that the senses weren't being overwhelmed at every moment.

It was serene.

But amidst this serenity, a new voice barged in like a bull in a china shop.

"Dora! Are you okay?!" Dora raised her head and observed Fancy dusting herself off and spreading her majestic wings.

"Fancy?"

Dora rushed towards

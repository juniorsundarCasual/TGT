While Guy formulated his plans to improve the psychological health of the True World Sect members as well as raising their overall moral base, the caravan continued its paced crawl through the capital. The path was clear and wide, with minimal deviations barring the two enormous bridges connecting the two banks of the Indigo-Chill and the Ragged-Current rivers. Along the way, the caravan met with others heading the same direction, until eventually a long line of slow moving traffic started to form.

The line moved at a snail's pace, but it moved forward nonetheless. And as it did so, the capital's grand form started to draw closer, until it spanned the entire horizon. Once the capital grew large enough to cover every inch of Guy's line of sight, he was drawn out of his contemplative stupor and managed to fully absorb the great beast which could very well have been larger than the largest cities back on Earth. A massive wall of red stone surrounded the city. Intermittently scattered around the walls were openings and entrances that were strictly policed by squadrons of heavily armoured and armed guards. Many lines of caravans, carriages and even walkers converged to these entrances and awaited the go-ahead from the walking metal cans of death. The filter was stringent, no one without proper identification and purpose of entry could pass the gates.

From a distance, Guy was enamoured by the sheer scale of the structure and its imposing architecture. But upon arriving closer, his awe faltered and was replaced by a worried and affected frown. During their journey to the capital, and a bit prior as well, Guy had grown aware of the impending refugee crisis affecting the Empire. Horde of refugees were escaping the harsh North and seeking asylum in the South. This type of mass movement of people from regions of conflict wasn't a new experience for Guy, for he had travelled through many such places in his previous life. It was an horrid affair - to give up one's home because living there no longer becomes tractable is a horrible feeling. Worse yet is to seek out newer pastures but being denied the possibility to start anew and being forced to live like animals - to be herded, contained and live off of scraps. It is dehumanising.

The decision to accept and allow refugees to assimilate into the local diaspora is a decision that must stem from the goodness of one's heart. Unfortunately, most political decisions and steeped in bias and selfishness. No matter how much people argue over the benefits of allowing refugees to immigrate and assimilate, a good portion of politicians stand against the choice because they inherently fear dilution of the original culture and "staining" of the common values that prevail in the region. The problem shifts from talking about people, to talking about the abstract concept of the nation itself.

To an extent, this selfishness and bias was smothered in Guy's previous life for one crucial reason - the Internet. The Internet makes people who have public profiles accountable for their words and their actions. A politician can no longer get away with lying blatantly. A politician cannot get away with throwing around racial slurs and discriminatory talks. A politician cannot denounce the meat industry and get caught eating a juicy hamburger in a global fast-food franchise. 

Furthermore, with the prevailing concepts of free-speech and human rights, politicians can quickly find their careers in murky waters if their official stance on topics such as mass-migration of refugees borders on inhumane territories. Because of this, the reception of refugees back on Earth was far superior to the conditions they faced in this one.

The people on Gaea lacked the motivation to care about a fellow human because the basic human is selfish by design - it is an animalistic instinct to care for oneself before others. Only a select few are selfless - these folk cannot be found in political offices. On Earth, these selfish mooks were kept in check and motivated to be selfless since their actions and words were forever immortalised on the Internet. One wouldn't want their legacy to be a collection of colourful phrases denigrating refugees! On Gaea, without the Internet maintaining checks and balances, there was no such motivation. For one, there was no such thing as equality in this world given the class divides in place. Secondly, the newspapers were a joke - they lacked substance and depth. Who would people complain to? What would they complain about? Ultimately, would it even matter?

At that moment, Guy saw one of the guards punch a grovelling man garbed in tattered clothes and wearing a sack for a shirt in his gut. The man collapsed with a loud wheeze, and was then unceremoniously lifted and tossed to the side like a ragdoll, only to be carried away by a few of his equally destitute brethren.

"Are they allowed to do that?" Guy could not help by blurt out. He couldn't stand the sight at all!

As he followed the men carrying the groaning man, he found a large congregation of haphazard tents and a short distance away from the walls, going along it. The tents were made of simple cloth, leather for select few who had the Within this congregation, Guy caught a horde of men, women and a few children wearing equally deteriorating clothes and living in overall squalor. An aura of loss and despondance hung over this horde; just one look and Guy could tell that these were refugees. Guy's heart ached seeing the kids running barefoot and extremely malnourished, scooping and shoving handful of mud into their mouths.

"That's not hygienic!" Jean said worriedly. She also saw the sad state of affairs and her healer heart screamed with sorrow. "Why are they being coralled here like this? It is unsafe, unhealthy and improper..." She droned on.

"It is a multi-faceted issue"

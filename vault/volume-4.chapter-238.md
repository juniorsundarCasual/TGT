Once the caravan exited the Rasmus March the next, and final, territory in their way to the Capital was the Regal Plains. In his entire two lives, Guy had never seen such an abrupt transition from one landscape to the next. As they were traversing through sparse shrubbery, everything just suddenly ended and turned into an endless expanse of nothing as far as the eye could see. Guy had never seen so much of nothing in his entire life. There was so little perturbing the still flatness of the plains that Guy could actually see the curvature of the globe along the horizon.

Upon entering the Regal Plains, the caravan's ambience discharged visibly, even more so compared to the change following the revelation of Guy and Markus' powers and Jean's parentage. After some contemplation, it made total sense. Only an idiot would ambush a caravan in such an undefendable and exposed setting. There was no cover to hide behind, or obstacles to weave around, both the attackers and defenders would be sitting ducks with the advantage in the defenders' favour since they could anticipate and prepare for the attack. Of course, this didn't stop some rogue parties from intercepting the caravan - there was never a lack of idiots in the world.

Most of the ones that did intercept the caravan were clearly amateurs, living a desperate life, struggling to survive. Their attempts to shake-down the caravan for food or money were half-baked, superficial. They were more scared than anything else. So Guy took the initiative in those instances and calmed them down with his power, rather than letting the Whispering Dusk members butcher them without prejudice. More often than nought they were refugees egged into joining a raid by a few bad actors, so why amputate the whole arm if the problem stems from a single finger? Once the troublemakers were isolated, they were bundled up into a neat package and delivered to one of many watchtowers breaking the Regal Plain's monotonous landscapes.

"This is the sixth group," Korren, the leader of the Whispering Dusk escort regiment commented as the patrol guards dragged in a chained and unconscious prisoner into the watchtower's holding cell. "It's highly unusual."

Guy cocked his eyebrows inquisitively, to which Korren expounded, "Its more than what we've had to contend against in this region from the last ten trips combined! The refugee crisis is getting way out of hand."

With increasing turmoil in the Kingdom up north, more and more refugees were evacuating towards the Solar Empire. Guy had the opportunity to witness this first-hand in Radiant City a while back. Droves of roughshod and tired men and women were flocking and camping outside City premises. Their living conditions were abysmal, and extremely treacherous - it reminded Guy a lot of the mass refugee migration taking place in his previous life at the time of his death except this was much, much worse.

"I don't understand why you're bothering with all of this, anyways," Korren sighed as they returned to the moving caravan. "Why bother subduing these miscreants and handing them over to the guards? Can't we just kill them and be done with it? Its more efficient, not like anyone will miss them?"

Guy held back a sneer over the man's callous disregard for the sanctity of a life and said, "We live in a society. Society has rules. We follow rules so that the society we have built doesn't fall apart."

"Rules are in place to keep the weak and inconsequentials in line and make them feel safe," Korren said with a snort.

"Is it better to be feared or respected?" Guy asked.

"Can't we have both?" Korren joked, to which Guy shook his head and responded, "It is easy to espouse fear, but respect is harder to earn and much easier to lose. Both can be used to motivate someone to do something, however fear stems from negative emotions while respect is deeply rooted in the positive spectrum."

"What's the point of all this?" Korren inquired with narrowed eyes filled with confusion.

"What I'm trying to say is that a person who fears you will follow your commands, but you will always have to worry about being stabbed in the back. However, a person who respects you will follow your command, and will have your back at your time of need," Guy elaborated. "The reign of a person ruling with fear is on borrowed time, while a person reigning with respect will succeed to creating a Dynasty that can transcend time."

"I still don't get where this is going."

<!-- "A functioning society is built on order. Order is maintained with rules and laws. If enforced in a uniform manner irrespective of a person's background, these rules and laws can ensure that order doesn't crumble to the ground. " -->

A sombre gathering formed in a meeting room inside the Sect's clinic building. All the core members of the Sect when it was first established - the Sect Leader, Elder Nara, Markus, Marie, Jean and Matron Reva - were present.

"Marie! In the middle, now!" The Sect Leader growled, causing the targetted girl to flinch in surprise. She had never heard the Sect Leader speak with such an incensed voice. There was a silent anger in there that unnerved her usual cool demeanour. She slowly got up and walked towards the chair in the middle of the U-shaped table. She shifted uncomfortably as the Sect Leader drilled into her.

"Did you know about Shuri's condition?"

"Wha-"

"DID YOU KNOW?" The Sect Leader cut Marie while slapping the wooden table audibly.

"I-I did," Marie answered hastily.

"And you opted not to tell me, why?" He responded icily.

"W-Well I foresaw that it would work itself out-"

"Work itself out in what way?!" The Sect Leader cut in again. "Tell me everything you know, and leave out no detail. I don't want anymore surprises, got it?"

Marie swallowed a dry gulp of air and started speaking with a slow and steady voice, "She was supposed to die, but I orchestrated the event so that Markus would end up saving her and would rope her into the Sect."

"Why?"

"Why, what? Why did I save her? Or why did I want to rope her into our Sect?" Marie probed, though it was met with only silence from the Sect Leader. "I save her because I wanted her in the Sect. Shuri is special, I'm sure you've already seen that. Her skills and her past place her in a very unique position which I think will be extremely beneficial for the Sect."

"Look, Marie," the Sect Leader said with a tired sigh as his stern expression loosened slightly. "The problem isn't in saving Shuri, but what comes after. I'm sure that when you chose to save her, you also saw her past and glimpsed into her future. So if anyone knew Shuri better than herself when she joined the Sect, it would have to be you. I just don't understand why you didn't think it necessary to share the fact that she was going through such a difficult situation psychologically. If I had known earlier, I could have taken steps to stop what just happened from occurring. Do you even know what she is going through?"

"I didn't see this," Marie admitted. "I sort of skipped a bit ahead, and things looked quite green there."

The Sect Leader looked past Marie and gazed at her Master, who was also wearing a thoughtful frown. "Could you explain to your Disciple what Shuri is experiencing right now?"

Elder Nara hummed affirmatively before saying, "The transition from Foundation Establishment to the Core Formation realm is first initiated by a sudden increase in density of the mana core. To achieve this, the world shoves a large quantity of mana into the core. It is supposed to be a painful process - extremely so - however, the process of apotheosis circumvents this pain as the physical form is held in a non-solid (immaterial) state while it is being reinvented and rebuilt. By the time apotheosis finishes, the mana core reaches its critical density, then completing the transition between realms. However, since Shuri couldn't initiate apotheosis, the mana core's condensaton was preempted prematurely, meaning that if ever he uses mana from his core he will experience immeasurable pain."

"She," Sect Leader Larks corrected.

"Eh?" Elder Nara blurted out.

"Shuri is a she. You called her a 'he'," Sect Leader Larks expounded.

"But the kid is a boy," Elder Nara reasoned with a confused tone. "Why would I refer to him as a 'she'."

"It is because she identifies as a girl, a female," Sect Leader Larks explained.

"So?" Elder Nara asked with even more confusion. "Even if he claims to be a girl, he isn't a girl. He's clearly a boy."

There was silence in the room, with only the dull sound of the Sect Leader tapping his fingers together echoing periodically.

"If she succeeded in her apotheosis and solidifed her biological gender as a female, would she be a girl?" Sect Leader Larks asked.

"Well, yes."

"But she didn't succeed even though she really wanted to be identified as a girl," the Sect Leader highlighted.

"Of course! It's because it is in contrast to her true nature," Elder Nara affirmed.

"But dragons can take on human form after apotheosis. So can a lot of other magical creatures. How is that possible?"

Elder Nara contemplated on that question. After a few seconds the Sect Leader followed up by saying, "So a transition between species is acceptable, but not between genders within the same species?"

"What are you trying to say?" Elder Nara said while letting out a frustrated breath.

"That one's identity is tethered to one's perception of reality, just like their cultivaiton. Shuri's reality dictates that her gender identity is female, even though she is biologically a male. It isn't just a whimsical thought, like a phase that will pass eventually. It is her fact. We should respect that," the Sect Leader stated seriously.

"I don't get it... So the boy is a girl and I should refer to him as one?" Elder Nara said with a scoff.

"If you can call a dragon transformed into a human as a human, then you can call a boy who hasn't yet transitioned into a girl but wishes to do so, as a girl as well," Sect Leader Larks declared.

"I don't see the relation," Elder Nara mumbled, but the gathering ignored his words and moved on.

"Look, if you know that someone is suffering from an illness, be it physical or psychological, it is your duty to bring it up with those that can help them through it," the Sect Leader pointed out.

"But this wasn't my secret to share," Marie argued. "I couldn't reveal it if Shuri didn't want it to be known."

"It doesn't apply to cases when someone is going to potentially cause harm to themselves or others," Sect Leader Larks corrected. "Look at what happened to Shuri. Because we couldn't address her mental blocks earlier, she now has to suffer with excruciating pain while teetering part ways between Foundation Establishment and Core Formation realm, until she can finally complete her advancement."

Marie looked down guiltily. "So what do we do?"

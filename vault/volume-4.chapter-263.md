Recruitment day. The event that sects all over the Empire ardently look forward to, since it is a unique opportunity for them to dip into a truly diverse pool of applicants and pick up a horde of new sect members. Sect were true adherents to the principles of natural selection, and for it to work appropriately, a large influx population is a necessity.

The sect atmosphere works as a gauntlet, weeding out members one after another until only those truly desperate, persistent, or talented enough remain. The desperate and persistent remain at the bottom-most rung of the ladder, cursed to never climb it. Those desperate and talented, they are cursed to be forever taken advantage of by the sect. It is those that are persistent and talented that can bask in all that the sect has to offer and thrive in its unforgiving environment. Of course, this overlooks the rare occurrence of the wealthy and connected. These specimens need not be talented, nor is it necessary for them to have the persistence. Since the sect is incentivised to keep this cash-cows in their ranks as it automatically comes with a lot of benefits.

In a sense, Jean happens to be one such cash-cow for the True World Sect. Although Markus would more than love to deny that claim, one look around his current living arrangement held those rebuttals from exiting his mouths.

Although, even if Jean weren't highborn, there would still be a place for her in the True World Sect. That was the beauty and unique selling point of Markus' sect.

"For our recruitment, I want to be more selective and deliberate over the people I want joining the Sect," his Master said as Markus and Jean entered the event grounds.

"Are we setting a cultivation baseline for our recruits?" Markus inquired. He couldn't stop the surprise from leaking into his tone.

"No," his Master responded with a shake of his head. "Its less to do with their cultivation and more to do with their character. Remember what I asked you when I first started teaching you guys about magic?"

"About why I wanted to become a mage?" Jean probed.

"Think back to your answer at that time," his Master suggested. "Markus here wanted to protect his family. Jean wanted to become a healer."

The man paused, turned to face Markus and Jean and declared, "I want people that are learning magic to help the world or others rather than themselves. Doesn't matter if they aren't talented in magic, doesn't matter what social class they come from. They must be passionate and selfless in their pursuits."

"It may sound naive, but we all know that magic has the power to corrupt its user. If the mage's starting point is selfish, they will only get more and more detached from the world as they advance," his Master added.

"So... how will we be sifting through the applicants?" Jean chimed in. "Will we be asking the same question to them? How will we judge if their answer is adequate?"

"Hmm..."

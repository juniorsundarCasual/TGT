Recruitment day. The event that sects all over the Empire ardently look forward to, since it is a unique opportunity for them to dip into a truly diverse pool of applicants and pick up a horde of new sect members. Sect were true adherents to the principles of natural selection, and for it to work appropriately, a large influx population is a necessity.

The sect atmosphere works as a gauntlet, weeding out members one after another until only those truly desperate, persistent, or talented enough remain. The desperate and persistent remain at the bottom-most rung of the ladder, cursed to never climb it. Those desperate and talented, they are cursed to be forever taken advantage of by the sect. It is those that are persistent and talented that can bask in all that the sect has to offer and thrive in its unforgiving environment. Of course, this overlooks the rare occurrence of the wealthy and connected. These specimens need not be talented, nor is it necessary for them to have the persistence. Since the sect is incentivised to keep this cash-cows in their ranks as it automatically comes with a lot of benefits.

In a sense, Jean happens to be one such cash-cow for the True World Sect. Although Markus would more than love to deny that claim, one look around his current living arrangement held those rebuttals from exiting his mouths.

Although, even if Jean weren't highborn, there would still be a place for her in the True World Sect. That was the beauty and unique selling point of Markus' sect.

"For our recruitment, I want to be more selective and deliberate over the people I want joining the Sect," his Master said as Markus and Jean entered the event grounds. All three carried wooden crates in their hands, with their heads barely peaking over it.

"Are we setting a cultivation baseline for our recruits?" Markus inquired. He couldn't stop the surprise from leaking into his tone.

"No," his Master responded with a shake of his head. "Its less to do with their cultivation and more to do with their character. Remember what I asked you when I first started teaching you guys about magic?"

"About why I wanted to become a mage?" Jean probed.

"Think back to your answer at that time," his Master suggested. "Markus here wanted to protect his family. Jean wanted to become a healer."

The man paused, turned to face Markus and Jean and declared, "I want people that are learning magic to help the world or others rather than themselves. Doesn't matter if they aren't talented in magic, doesn't matter what social class they come from. They must be passionate and selfless in their pursuits."

"It may sound naive, but we all know that magic has the power to corrupt its user. If the mage's starting point is selfish, they will only get more and more detached from the world as they advance," his Master added.

"So... how will we be sifting through the applicants?" Jean chimed in. "Will we be asking the same question to them? How will we judge if their answer is adequate?"

"Hmm..." Master Larks rubbed his chin thoughtfully before extending a finger and poking Jean and Markus in their bellies, "Use this."

"Our gut?" Markus deciphered immediately.

"I know what you're thinking. That you guys aren't experienced enough to make those judgement calls. But you forget that you are in a unique position to actually decide who gets to be your college for what could be the rest of your lives. This does not mean that you need to look out for people who share your opinions, or have similar views on life. What you need to look out for are people who share a similar mindset, people you wouldn't mind working with for the foreseeable future (because these folks will be accompanying you for the rest of your lives)."

Markus hummed and admitted, "That does narrow our search a little-bit."

And like that, the trio wove through the burgeoning crowd and arrived at their stand. The Alliance offered certain services to sects participating in this event in regard to setting up the stalls. For a small fee, they would put up a standard kiosk with the respective sect's logo and name emblazoned atop it for all to see. With some additional payment, they would also provide features such as strength and cultivation testers, training weapons, and other equipment that may find some use when evaluating the quality of recruits.

Master Larks opted for the standard kiosk, which was plain in content. Then, Master opened up one of the boxes that they carried in and pulled out a bundle of hollow sticks, connected with a tough rope weaving through their centres. He placed the sticks in a line and pulled the rope, causing them all to slot together to form one large pole. From the same box, he retrieved another wooden square prism about an arm's length, with a conspicuous slot at its top the exact same radius as the pole. The pole went in, and his Master pulled a string hanging out of a thin and long slot below the pole slot, causing a long sheet of cloth to unfurl. The string was then tethered to the top of the pole.

Taking a step back, Markus saw what looked like a sailboat with just its sails. The cloth that acted as the sail was a banner with details about the True World Sect printed on it. It listed details such as the Sect's vision and mission, specialities, brief history, locale (nothing too specific), facilities, expectations, and goals for the future.

"Is this the retractable banner stand, Master?" Markus inquired while approaching the ingenious apparatus.

"Yeah. People will keep passing by us, we need to have a way for them to know what our sect stands for at a glance," his Master explained. "There are two more inside. You saw how I put this one up, you and Jean can go ahead and assemble those ones."

With those instructions given, his Master opened another box and started to pull out more odds and ends and put them up for display on the stands at the centre of the kiosk. There was a wand, similar to the one's Markus, Jean and Marie used. There were books of different kind, probably to show off the printing press (one of the Sect's most lucrative inventions). There were a plethora of tools such as hand drills, screws and screwdrivers, and assemblies that utilised these tools in some way to show off their functions. These were new additions to the Sect's catalogue borne of the lathe and milling machine. Master also retrieved miniature wood carvings that exemplified a range of uses of the two machines.

"Master, I still don't fully understand the purpose of having these items here," Markus commented.

"Every sect has a specialisation. Cloudstrider Sect pride themselves on their ritual formations, for instance. A sect may specialise in Alchemy, or Blacksmithing, or even Cooking as I've recently come to learn."

They found out that there was a niche segment of the market that specialised in cooking just for mages (hence Cooking with a capital 'C'). The ingredients used were mana charged, and the meat is sourced from monsters and beasts that had the capacity for magic. The benefit of eating such mana dense and infused foods was that it worked similar to alchemical potions and reagents but in a much slower and elongated way. Furthermore, it was proven to be safer and

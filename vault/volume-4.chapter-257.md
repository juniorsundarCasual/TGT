Following a temporary waylaying, Marie returned to her quest of enlightenment with renewed resolve, with her Master in tow this time. Marie appreciated that her Master took the initiative to do so. Even if he had little to no idea of what she was doing, his simple presence and infrequent words uplifted her spirits greatly. And although her Master's expertise may not lay in line with her own, he was a post-post-post-post-human with mental and physical faculties four-levels beyond her own mortal limits. In all honestly, 'four-levels' just didn't capture the massive gully separating her from her Master in terms of brain power, raw power, magical power, and soul power.

Case in point. A monumentous task that she estimated would take her many years (at least half of her mortal life) was accomplished in a week thanks to her Master's intervention. Ignoring the specifics of the task, her Master leveraged his parallel thinking and wide sensory capacity to run all four quadropods positioned around the central Celestial Recording Platform simultaneously. Obsidian plates rushed in and out of shelves at a feverish pace as her Master finished recording the pertinent information affiliated with the current plate within minutes of it reaching the projection area. All the while, four set of brushes hovered elegantly over four different parchments of paper, jotting down notes into a table.

So what exactly was he Master doing by juggling all the plates, papers and brushes all at once?

Marie's first order of business was to establish a viable line of study. There were a lot of variables and parameters up in the air that could be considered and included in her model of the world. Each new element considered would bring it closer to reality, however it would also balloon up her calculations substantially. But, as the saying went, to end something one needed to start somewhere first. Rather than preoccupying herself with the factors beyond her control and realm of expertise, she could make do with was within her capacity.

For that reason, Marie decided to narrow her scope of research - mapping the movement of the planets bodies within the Solar System through the years. She kept the Sun as the base reference frame and established a relative axis where an x-y plane is formed on the place in which Gaea orbits around the sun. The x-axis can be drawn pointing from the sun to Gaea. The z-axis is perpendicular to the plain and is determined from the fact that Gaea orbits the Sun in a counter-clockwise direction, which in turn provides the relative y-axis. (Open right hand into a palm and point all fingers in the x-direction, then orient thumb in direction of z-axis. The direction the palm is facing is the y-axis). This essentially keeps the Sun and Gaea along a singular axis.

With a proper frame established, she then had to determine a suitable method of measurement. The three-dimensional projection of outer space was perfectly to scale. So any distance measured would be accurate to its real life counterpart. This was where Marie was glad that her Master was present and willing to assist.

After spending a decent chunk of time explaining the definition of proper standard units of measurements, her Master learned how to measure distances in metres. Marie opted for the exact definition of the unit, through the use of the speed of light as a reference, since she intended to use light as a basis to the unit of measurement for objects in space that are separated by large distances. She's heard Mister Larks say it once or twice in passing: the word 'light-year'. She thought it was just another one of those quirky phrases that he'd mumble on a regular day. Now though, it all made sense. It defined the distance covered by light in a year. In outer space, where distances are in extremely large magnitudes, this was perfect!

Her Master was quick on the uptake. All she had to do was drill in the fact that nothing could go faster than light, which led to a minor verbal debate where her Master was adamant that he knew mages who could go faster. There was a minor segue when Marie threw out a thought experiment with the faster-than-light-man and what he would see if he were to hold a mirror when running that fast. That put her Master out of commission for a few hours as his brain shutdown and restarted multiple times. In the end he gave up arguing and just went with her explanation.

Now, her Master could measure the light-years within seconds. All he did was zoom the projection at a constant speed while mentally measuring the distance. To measure the distance from the Sun to Gaea took him half a second - all Marie saw was the projection expanding and rebounding with a nearly imperceptible flicker. The sceptic that she was, Marie verified the measurements and was surprised to find that her Master's measurements were far more precise than her own.

Her Master was thus assigned the task to record the coordinates of all the planets and moons in the solar system for every day recorded starting from the most recent one (a single reading of position of the celestial bodies for every day). A daily reading was sufficient since going into the hourlies would be equivalent to splitting hairs.

Although her Master could keep up with this task, the very first point of concern was the

The duo arrived at Dawnbreak Town right as the dockworkers were leaving for their lunch breaks. Lea proceeded to offload her goods, a process Liam inserted himself into going against Lea's repeated insistence. He carried the stack of baskets all by himself and deposited it at Lea's usual spot. Marie and Krish split off around that point, noticing that Liam had also insisted upon managing the sales of the dumplings before they parted ways.

"He's a kind man," Marie commented.

"Kindness borne of selfishness," Krish responded cryptically.

"He doesn't seem interested in receiving a payment, though," Marie countered with a frown. Krish stopped in place and gazed pointedly at his Disciple. It looked as though he intended to say something, but he swallowed his words and simply moved past her.

"Hey, wait up!" Marie jogged after her elusive Master who glided over the ground while still walking with a visible hobble.

This wasn't Marie's first time coming to Dawnbreak Town. Most of her earlier assignments with merchant caravans passing through Wayward Town would end at this junction. Since there were no rivers flowing into the sea within the Maika Duchy, merchants that wished to transport their goods overseas had to inevitably converge at Dawnbreak Town. Although the Maika Duchy had the largest coastline within the Solar Empire, a large portion of it was inaccessible to large vessels and ships either due to extremely shallow waters or cliff and mountainous regions. Dawnbreak Town happened to have the perfect conditions for establishing a port and dock for both trading and overseas travel, and was thus one of the first few towns established within the Solar Empire. Currently, its size rivalled that of a small- to medium-sized city. The only reason keeping the 'Town' designation in place was the fact that the population was sparse in comparison to the town's physical span.

Most of Dawnbreak Town - almost three-quarters of it - was made up of docks and ports. Various ships and cargo vessels were anchored in these locations, loading and unloading both cargo and people. Right opposite the docks and port was a sprawling market with high foot-traffic and wide variety of offering both local and foreign in nature. Much like the hasty sales made in Wayward Town by merchants looking to offload possible loss-making goods, the market opposite the docks served a similar purpose. Often times, certain imported goods or goods set to be transported out may not survive the trip to its intended destination. Thus, to recoup the costs, these goods are sold at a more discounted rate. People within the Duchy would travel in from far and wide to benefit from these discounts, it would be impossible to get foreign products at such prices otherwise.

"I suppose our purpose is beyond shopping?" Marie snorted as she inspected a quaint yet charming doll made of palm fronds displayed on a seller's stand. Palms trees weren't common in the Solar Empire. They were endemic to the Red Waste

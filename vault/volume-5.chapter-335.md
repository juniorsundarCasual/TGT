Jean had never been struck by her father before. Today was the first time, yet the resounding slap did not sting or hurt at all because she was immediately plunged into a warm and enveloping hug after that.

"Don't you DARE do anything stupid like this EVER AGAIN!" Her father's voice reverberated through his chest and shook her body.

"Nothing ventured, nothing gained," Uncle Al said from the side, but was immediately silenced with a deathly glare from her father. "Look, Goran..."

"Do not make excuses for the girl!" Her father yelled. "And please, do not try to downplay the danger and idiocy of her decision just because she succeeded. What if she failed?! There goes another loved one who I can't even bury or cremate because the forsaken Plague took everything!"

Jean noticed her father edging towards hyperventilation. It was clear that the man had nearly lost a few years of his life within the hours taken to fly from the Rasmus Mansion in Radiant City to they current location. His rationality was in tatters and his mind was addled.

"How did you know that I was here?" Jean inquired.

"We received a mail," Uncle Jeeves answered.

"Let me guess, Marie?" Jean snapped back and followed it up with an exhausted sigh when Uncle Jeeves nodded affirmatively. "Well, I will admit once again that she has impeccable timing."

"Bullshit!" Goran sputtered. "First off, why did I have to hear all of this from Marie? Why can't my daughter inform me before she sets out to, let's just say it as it is, forfeit her life?"

"Your mother knew that too!" Goran responded angrily. "Look at what she went and did..."

"All the more reason for you to trust me to be cautious and prudent with my life," Jean reasoned, though it was clear that her father was having none of it. So she acquiesced to her father's worried gaze and said "Okay, I apologise for my stupidity. I promise I won't do anything like this ever again. And if I do, which as I said would never happen, I will make sure to inform you first."

Goran stared meaningfully into Jean's eyes before exhaling in defeat, "Your eyes sparkle with the same spirit as your mother's did. For that reason, I cannot believe you. But I know that as you are your mother's child, there is nothing I can do to stop you."

At that point Uncle Jeeves stepped in and patted her father's back. "Stop moping around when there's nothing to mope about. In fact, we should be celebrating! Jean's achieved something truly revolutionary; she's developed a cure for the Plague of Dark Cleansing."

Uncle Jeeves turned to Jean and added, "You have done the world a great service. And on a personal note, you have raised me from a single level of my personal hell. This Plague... I am truly shameful for what my student has done, and I will wear his wrongdoings upon me as a garland of thorns. I wished to be the one to relinquish the world of his "

The duo arrive at the Town around when the dock workers take their break time.

Marie takes the time to inquire Krish about the next leg of their travel. Knowing that their destination is somewhere out into the sea, how were they to get there?

Krish tells her that the first step is to get into the sea and to worry about what comes after later. He then drags them to a mansion belonging to a merchant famous in the region for his vast fleet of trading ships. Krish manages to bypass all the security mysteriously, as though they couldn't see or hear him. He walks right into the main office deep within the mansion, where the owner, an aged man possibly in his late fifties, sat perusing through stacks of reports and financial statements at a measured pace.

The man reads the scroll in its entirety. Once finished, he chortles with laughter and says: "So you're the mysterious man grandpa told me about! Well, what can ____ do for you, Master Mage?"

Marie keeps stealing glances from Krish as they walked through the streets of Dawnbreak Town. Krish lets out an amused chuckle and proceeds to satisfy his Disciple's curiosity of how he earned the eternal favour of one of the largest overseas trader of the Solar Empire. He tells then of how he saved the man drowning in death with a few investment opportunities.

Though while Krish is explaining, he suddenly stops speaking and gazes down a dark alley. Marie follows his gaze and inquires what's going on. Krish releases a tired sigh and leads her into the alley.

Marie follows cautiously, until the heavy smell of blood assaults her senses. Narrowing her gaze, she suddenly gazes upon tw

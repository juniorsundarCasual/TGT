Shyn Raynor had prepared extensively for a myriad of possibilities and scenarios that he could experience in his daily life. Amongst those scenarios, the ones he rehearsed the most for involved his life and its security. He was, after all, an extremely affluent man with generations worth of wealth supporting him. He'd ruffled an uncountable amount of feathers in reaching this far, that is excluding the already innumerable opponents his father and fore-father had garnered through their ventures.

To wit, his ancestor who first broke ground for the mansion he was currently living in had installed some pretty basic protective measures in anticipation of such dangers. Over the years, and through each subsequent generation, the security systems were built upon until eventually the mansion and its surrounding grounds had turned into a veritable fortress. It may not look it at first glance, but not even a fly could enter the grounds without raising a plethora of alarms. There were redundancies upon redundancies in place for this very reason.

Now imagine Shyn's utter horror when two seemingly mundane-looking folk, an elderly man who looked around the same age as himself and a teenage girl, simply popped into existance right within his office - the part of his mansion which should have, on paper, the highest level of protection! Shyn was smart enough to realise that the fact that they could reach so far, regardless of their methods, meant their strength trounced everything he and all of his ancestors had installed for protection.

'A Tesseract Transformation realm expert!' Shyn surmised and swallowed a difficult gulp of saliva. His most recent additions had been tested for their effectiveness by the most elusive of mages in the Core Condensation realm - specifically mages specialising in infiltration and assassination who'd "turned a new leaf" and now worked in security systems. If this man could do something that experts in their field couldn't, there was only one conclusion which was that Shyn could under no circumstances mess with this man and earn his ire if he wished to get out of this interaction with his life intact.

Once that sobering thought finally settled in Shyn's floundering mind, a wave of calm washed over him. He'd realised that a rephrasing of question was in order.

"What can this one do for an esteemed mage such as yourself, Master Mage?" Shyn said with an over-the-top but believably sincere level of respect.

The mage in question approached Shyn's desk and rested the walking stick he was using for support against the chair.

'A method of deception,' Shyn decided. Who would suspect a semi-cripple man walking with a limp to annihalate someone with a snap of their finger?

The mage gazed blankly at Shyn while the girl followed and took the second seat opposite the table. The silence grew increasingly uncomfortable as neither party initiated a dialogue. Until eventually, the mage released a sigh and said, "Your eyes are a lot like Maynor's, now that I think about it. I can see the resemblance in your frames as well."

"Maynor...?" Shyn murmured. "Are you by any chance referring to my great-grandfather?"

"I don't know. Thin guy, really long, dirty brown hair- Died about 135 years ago..." the mage muttered. "Anyway, what matters is that I have confirmed that you are in fact a descendent of Maynor. Hence, we can now proceed with the transaction."

"Transaction?" The Shyn repeated with anxiousness creeping up his voice. Conducting business with mages was... undesireable. Their breed never behaved following predictable conventions. It was best to leave mages to their own devices - let them fight amongst themselves. This was why Shyn avoided touching anything related to cultivation and the path of magehood. It was what his father taught him, and so did his grandfather.

'Just what trouble did you get us into, great-grandfather,' Shyn grieved. 'You brought our business into this world and paved the way for it to reach such heights. I hope its unmaking isn't by your hands.'

Shyn followed the mage's had as it reached into the simple bag slung over his shoulders. From it, he retrieved a ceramic, cylindrical canister with a metal clasp at its bottom. The canister had symbols snaking around it with a systematic design. Just laying his eyes on it cause Shayn to involuntarily release a gasp.

"You've seen this before," the mage commented matter-of-factly. Shyn stood up and beelined towards a bookshelf behind him. He counted off three shelves from the bottom, and then thirteen books from the left. The book upon which his finger landed was then pushed in, causing the shelf to slide inwards to reveal a locked box. He placed his hand over the lockbox, which started to blink with a blue luminesence, and only removed it once the light settled on a solid green. He lifted the lid of the box and retreived a similar ceramic canister from within.

"The Sect Elders have been asking me why I'm bending over backwards for someone from outside the Sect. They're confused if they should kick you out for your insolence or prostrate in front of you in fear," Jace jabbed as he approached a seated Krish. 

The recipient, the man seated atop a stone bench with a cross-legged posture and his walking stick resting on his lap, responded without turning. "So, what did you tell them?"

"I played the 'I'm dying, let this be my last wish' card and they acquiesced," Jace said with a snicker.

"You really are squeezing it for all it's worth, huh?"

"Better than sulking over it, anyways. So, why did you ask me to clear up the largest sparring field in our Sect for your Disciple?" Jace redirected. "Do you realise just how much whining I have to subject myself to? This entire Sect is filled with battle maniacs, and you've just asked me to deprive them of an outlet for their 'creativity'!"

"She needed a large chalkboard. Apparently, you troglodytes don't even have a regular-sized chalkboard. So, I decided to think outside the box." Krish waved his hands in front of him, gesturing at the large field with a flat yet textured stone flooring. "The field is basically a chalkboard laid flat on the ground."

Jace nodded contemplatively and said, "What does she need all this space for?"

Krish shrugged noncommittally. "I don't know."

"What a great Master you are..." Jace mocked sarcastically.

Krish scratched his forehead and released a sigh, "Listen, I basically spent a week doing banal scribe work. My mind decayed to a point that it has quite literally shut down. I cannot think nor can I reason. Let me have this moment to cleanse my mental palate. And please, spare me the witty digs, I lack the brain power to come up with an equally witty retort."

"You're no fun," Jace huffed and joined his old friend on the stone bench. The elderly duo then directed their attention towards the only other entity in their vicinity.

At the centre of the massive combat field, Marie was hunched over onto the ground, a while chalk in one hand and the other flipping through the pages of the Endless Book her Master used to log the celestial data points. The mental and spiritual decompression she experienced yesterday while gazing listlessly into the vibrant sunset had transitioned into a welcome ten-hour sleep. Upon waking up this morning, her mind was churning up ideas at a feverish pace. It was like a troublesome stopper inhibiting the free flow of thoughts was dislodged.

Without wasting another moment, she rushed to find her Master and asked for a large enough workspace to jot down her thoughts as they came. The way her mind was working, there were a lot of concepts and lines of reasoning that seemed disjointed, though she could feel that there was a connection if only she could see it altogether. However, resources of that kind were found to be lacking in this place. Through some quick thinking, her Master managed to sanction the largest combat field available. The irony of the moment wasn't lost on Marie - to use a haven for combat as a medium for academics - but she didn't have the luxury of dwelling on that. Every second where her hand wasn't actively scribbling out words was another second worth of lost ideas.

Incrementally, a large tapestry started to take shape on the ground of the combat field. Marie's hand danced mechanically while the chalk deposited its residue on the ground. She ran through on stick, then another, then another... very soon she lost track of how many chalks she'd consumed. It all started to blend in together.

Marie remembered Mister Larks' talk about Chaos Theory. Of how changing the initial conditions can greatly affect the behaviour of a nonlinear system down the line. It was all starting to make sense now. Her approach to the modelling problem was to collate all her known theories for planetary motion and try to apply them against the collected data to see if a close enough plot can be obtained.

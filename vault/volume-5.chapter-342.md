Shuri was finally ready to admit that she enjoyed learning in the True World Sect. Throughout her life, she was taught never to question anything, because questioning leads to finding out things that may not be conducive to a long and healthy life. So, she had to suppress her natural curiosity and live her life in ignorance.

But in the True World Sect, it was the exact opposite. She was encouraged to mess around and find out. Nothing remained unknown for long here as most, if not all, questions had an answer in the Library. And the great thing was that they were even forced to question the information available in the library.

This mindset was eye-opening in many ways. For one, it helped Shuri understand the cultivation methods and systems of Automagy in the Yoruz Clan's texts with a completely new perspective. By applying the principles of modular spellmaking and compartmentalisation, she could now see patterns in the inscriptions prescribed in the texts that alluded to particular behaviours and actions. She wanted to test out her theory earlier, but she recognised that it was a very expensive and time-consuming experiment. A mistake in the inscription would turn an entire mana core defective, and could also lead to catastrophic consequences if the inscription happens to succeed.

Earlier, Shuri did not want to take risks like that. But now, things were different. The circumstances had changed - there was no point in trying to conceal herself, and there was no necessity for it either. On top of that, there was now a feeling gnawing away at her from within telling her that it was time, and that if she didn't follow through she would miss out on something big.

An instinct.

What birthed this instinct?

Imagine a large and convoluted jig-saw puzzle, without any corner or edge pieces, and completely white. When Shuri learned the content from the Yoruz Clan's text, she managed to built a conjoined section. When she learned from the books in the reading list, she managed to build a conjoined section that completely encircled the previous clump. The last few sessions with Sect Leader Larks managed to bring to the forefront, the required pieces that would join up the encirclement with the clump at the centre. All Shuri needed to do now was find out what goes where.

She had an idea - an image prepared in her mind.

Shuri's hands moved automatically as it traced out the image in her mind on the projection. The AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR gates were familiar, she'd seen patterns in the Yoruz Clan's inscriptions that potentially had the same function. Now, it was a matter of testing the theory out.

In hindsight, she should probably test the hypothesised gates independently - for safety's sake, at least. But her instincts were urging her to throw caution to the wind and dive into the deep end right away.

Before she knew it, an hour had passed, but Shuri's hands showed no sign of stopping. She still had more to go!

Slowly, the image in her mind started to bloom on the ethereal canvas. And as this happened, unfelt by Shuri, her mana started to bubble frantically from her core. Above the dorms, a small whirlpool of mana started to take shape as well, attracting the attention of the Sect Leader and all others in the Foundation Establishment realms and above.

"Someone is advancing," Markus said as he approached his Master from behind. "Is it Shuri?"

"Feels that way," his Master responded. The duo were currently standing outside the dormitory building. "She ran out of our session today with a honed in expression, the kind you have when inspiration strikes you hard."

"Should we help her?" Markus probed worriedly.

"There's nothing we can do to help, actually. Her path is her own, after all," his Master responded with a thoughtful nod. "However, we CAN help in the clean-up. I'll go get something for her to eat after her advancement, she missed Lunch (again!). Can you go tell Grace to prepare some new clothes for the girl, she probably hasn't prepared a fresh change."

Markus' face turned crimson red in embarrassment as the boy turned and fled in Matron Reva's general direction.

"Your little pet project is finally advancing," Marie's Master commented while in meditation.

Marie hummed in affirmation before putting her documents aside.

"What's wrong? Taking a break?" Her Master probed.

"No. It's just that my efforts will become redundant very soon," Marie answered with a faint smile. "I can afford to waste a week or so."

Her Master looked at her with a confused expression before bursting into laughter. "I see," he said finally before returning to his meditative trance.

"Carry on, then," he added in the end. "And don't do anything I wouldn't do."

"That is an extremely specific warning, Master," Marie shot back with a sarcastic drawl. "I'll make sure to keep that in mind."

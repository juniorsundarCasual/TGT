"Your Highness, please let me!" An eager to please voice rushed forward.

Shuri ignored the girl and continued to pick up the broken ceramic scattered accross the marble floor. Some of it had fallen into the pond nearby, she'd have to pick that up later, unless-

A loud splash of water signalled the girl's dive into the pond to retrieve the debris from within. Shuri suppressed her irritation, measured her breath and continued her scrap retrieval endeavour.

"Why must they do this to Your Highness..." The girl murmured, loud enough for Shuri to hear. "This is totally unfair! Your Highness is also a Princess of the Solar Empire. Why must Your Highness have to suffer through this?!"

Her voice radiated with sincere righteousness - it burned Shuri at a spiritual level.

"Your Highness..." The girl pleaded as she waddled out of the pond, her hands filled with the rest of what remained of the ceramic plate. She slipped and accidentally nudged Shuri, causing the debris already in Shuri's hand to scrape a bit of flesh causing blood to leak out.

"OH NO! Your Highness please forgive this slave!" the girl pleaded and banged her head against the ground. Her skull cracked against the hard marble floor, there was no doubt the apology was sincere.

"Stop. You are attracting attention," Shuri growled albeit in an admittedly demure voice. Her attention did not leave the drop of blood fleeing the faint cut. With an audible sigh, she lowered her hand and looked at the prostrated figure of her most recent maid. It was a young girl, probably about Shuri's age. She had an innocent face, plump with baby fat. Her hair was common brown and tied into a neat braid - standard palace maid protocol.

"I-I just don't understand. Why did the Second Princess lie and inflate the value of the common ceramic plate found in the Palace Kitchens? Your Highness wasn't even the one who broke it, it was one of the Second Princess' maids!" The girl complained with indignation.

Shuri remembered exactly what the girl was talking about. It was hard for her to forget things, unpleasant interactions were especially so.

She had no idea what came upon her that urged her to leave the safe confines of her courtyard and roam around the large pond at the centre of the Inner Court. Deviation from the norm was a sure-fire way to get killed. And boy oh boy was it a close shave this time.

Shuri's younger sister, the Second Princess, was seated in the gazebo overlooking the pond, enjoying a spot of tea. She invited Shuri in for some and Shuri complied - better to roll with the punches. Shuri sat on pins and needles and barely managed to enjoy the wonderful blend from beyond the Vast Blue Expanse, as her entire attention was focused on the words leaving the Second Princess' mouth, honed to catch any verbal traps that came her way. Shuri managed to sidestep four such jabs all masked under layers upon layers of subterfuge: two poking at Shuri's insane and now-deceased mother, one aimed at her inability to cultivate, and the last one she wasn't so sure about - the intonation implied mockery, but it was vaguely uplifting. Nonetheless, disasters were being averted, but Shuri celebrated too soon.

A crash reverberated across the serene landscape. Although it was just a ceramic plate colliding against a marble floor, the noise was like a hundred explosions setting off all at once in Shuri's ears.

"Oh no!" The Second Princess evoked. The girl tried, but her acting barely made the cut. Then again, there was little reason for the girl to try, people would believe her regardless - such is the power of the Imperial Favour. "Elder Sister! You broke my most cherished plate. Consort Mother bought it for me from a renowned merchant from beyond the Vast Blue Expanse."

A faint smirk flashed past the Second Princess' face. Shuri was about to release a sigh, but caught the movement of her newest maid as she moved to refute the claim. Shuri quickly shot to her feet and said, "What to do? Younger Sister, do not fret. I shall fix it in no time. As long as all the pieces can be retrieved, the plate can be put back with magic."

"W-Will Elder Sister really collect all the pieces." There was no rise in tone at the end to indicate a question, that was a statement.

"Of course," Shuri said with a smile and proceeded to lower herself and collect the pieces one at a time. As the Second Princess' entourage left, the servant who tipped the plate over kicked some debris into the pond while walking past her.

"Younger Sister has the capital to flaunt her power," Shuri explained to her maid.

"B-But that is so unfair!"

'Naive,' Shuri thought and internally shook her head. "Such is the Palace. The Emperor dictates what is fair, and His Majesty's fairness is fickle - it comes just as easily as it goes."

The girl was taken aback for some reason. Her expression indicated a sense of disillusionment. Shuri could decipher the cause almost instantly. The girl was probably one of those starry-eyed folk who looked at the Palace and the Royal Family as the pinnacle of humanity. She probably volunteered to enter the Palace, unlike the vast majority of servants who were sold into the Palace by their family for a pretty price.

"But Your Highness-"

"Earlier," Shuri interrupted. She had little patience for simpletons. "Don't ever speak up on my behalf, EVER. If you do, then you must be prepared to face the consequences because I, for sure, won't take them on your behalf."

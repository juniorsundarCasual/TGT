Revian hummed for a few seconds and said, "I remember Senior Brother Markus saying that the primary reason why we use a wand early on is because our mana pools don't have the capacity to sustain a ranged spell. Why don't we start there?"

"How exactly do you suggest we do that?" Lacey challenged, causing Revian to shrink back.

"Come on, now," the boy eked out. "There are no bad ideas in a brainstorm..."

"Don't mind her," Kevan interjected while patting Revian's shoulder. "She's just too taken by the Socratic method."

The twin mumbled something under her and released a cold snort.

"There needs to be a way to standardise the process, so that no matter who performs the experiment, they will get the same result," Kevan reminded. "Think of ways to standardise the experiment, and I believe the answer we are looking for will present itself."

The group thought about the idea in silence, until something popped into Revian's mind. "Mana exhaustion!"

The exclamation was loud and attracted the attention of others in the library - a loud shush echoed from the other side causing the group's heads to shrink into their necks in embarrassment.

The twins gave Revian an annoyed glare while Kevan scooted closer and asked, "What are you talking about?"

"Mana exhaustion is something everyone experiences when they run out of mana. We can use that as a baseline for standardisation, right?"

"That's dangerous!" Casey interjected. "Senior Sister Jean warned us about the dangers of mana exhaustion. Besides, what can we even do with that as a baseline?"

"I don't know..." Revian mumbled. "Everyone has a different mana capacity in their cores. We don't know if mana consumption is constant accross a group of people casting the same spell. There's a lot of variables here. But, at the end of the day, mana exhaustion ties all of us together, does it not? Everyone suffers from it when they have drained their cores completely, which means that it is a valid condition to establish a baseline."

Kevan tapped the table with his fingers while thinking about Revian's hypothesis. "It could work, but it is dangerous."

"We can have someone on standby. Besides, I have an idea," Revian said while biting his lips and furrowing his brows in thought. "We won't have to remain in a state of exhaustion for long. We just need to hit complete exhaustion for a fraction of a second before replenishing it with a known quantity of mana and tracking its consumption."

"But that's not reliable. The mana core is naturally replenished by ambient mana. It's not going to give us a valid result," Kevan refuted.

"Not if we do this at a mana sink!" Lacey chimed in. "The nature of a mana sink is that it pulls all the ambient mana away, creating a naturally scarce area. It doesn't affect beings above Mana Condensation realm, but for us, it will definitely stop our cores from replenishing naturally!"

"Wait a minute! Isn't there supposedly a mana sink near the Sect?" Casey volleyed.

"Yeah! I heard Senior Sister Shuri found it," Lacey affirmed. "But it's all a bit hush-hush. Something important is happening there, I think."

"We could put in a request to use the area," Revian suggested. "I mean, the Sect hasn't stopped us from exploring our interests, right? Besides, this study has far-reaching consequences."

"Well," Kevan drew their attention with a firm declaration. "Since we have an inkling of what needs to be done, why don't we start writing out the design? It will definitely come to use when we apply for permission to access the mana sink."

Revian and the rest agreed with that deduction and got down to work. Tasks were quickly delegated, with the twins conducting background research and running the due-dilingence on safety procedures, while Revian and Kevan started to plot out the experimental procedure (i.e. the independent, dependent, and control variables as well as an outline about the steps that will be taken).

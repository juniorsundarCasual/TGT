"Do you think it's possible?" Shuri asked, finally breaking the elongated silence that hung between the three people. Marie, Shuri and Markus were currently in the recreation room modifying their lesson plans to implement the new Socratic seminars.

"If Master says its possible, it should be possible," Markus affirmed with a kind of resolve that stood on shaky ground. Shuri didn't know where he got that confidence from.

"I wasn't asking you, Senior Brother," Shuri mumbled while maintaining a respectful tone. In fact, her gaze was focused intensely on Marie.

"Don't look at me," Marie spoke up with a shrug.

"You're the only here who can see the future," Markus chimed in supportively.

"I don't know if your just deaf or wilfully ignorant," Marie snapped back. "I told you that I cannot use the Heavenly Eye."

Markus ignored that jab and reiterated, "But you still have that other method, don't you?"

Marie returned a blank stare, which was retaliated with an equally blank stare from Markus.

"..."

"You forgot about it... Didn't you?" Markus said with a tired exhalation.

Marie closed her eyes, accepting defeat and bathing in the shame. "You win this round..."

After saying that, she didn't open her eyes for some time - Shuri and Markus waited patiently for the girl to finish doing... whatever she was doing at the moment. A few seconds later, Marie's eyes opened, and she let out an impressed hum.

"So?" Markus nudged. "Does it work?"

"Umm..." Marie continued humming.

"Stop doing this, please," Shuri grumbled. "Just get to the point!"

"So according to my predictions, we will be able to meet the deadline," Marie confirmed.

"What else?" Markus egged.

"What do you mean 'what else'?" Marie responded while furrowing her brows. "I'm not a fortune dispenser"

"If you looked that far, you could have checked out more," Markus argued. "Whether the method works? Or if there's something we need to avoid? Maybe we can hit the deadline earlier."

Marie exchanged glances between the two expecting faces before frowning and shaking her head. "I'm going to go now. It's clear that you two aren't interested in planning the lessons."

"What are you talking about?" Markus shrieked immediately before grabbing the girl's hand as she was leaving.

"I've done my part," Marie declared. "I have confirmed that this isn't a wild goose chase, and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. You should feel more confident and more motivated to work. But all I see here is greed and hypocrisy."

After dropping those stinging words, Marie extricated herself from Markus' grasp and walked away in a huff.

"She does have a point," Shuri spoke up, causing Markus to jolt in place. "I mean, we hate it when she steers our lives. And here we are asking her to do something equivalent. It is hypocrisy, isn't it?"

"I guess," Markus admitted with a flustered fidget.

Shuri ejected a gust of air through her nose, massaged the back of her head and said, "Are you planning to implement the seminar for the topic on thermodynamics?"

Markus whistled while in contemplation and reasoned that, "Not everyone has reached that far. We've talked about thermal physics, and done a few experiments, but do you think introducing thermodynamics concepts is appropriate for the first ever seminar?"

"Why not? It offers a large breadth of discussion topics," Shuri said. "Why don't you try it with a smaller class size, kind of like an experiment, and see how it works? Besides, according to the booklet, a Socratic seminar is meant to be implemented with few participants, eight to fifteen individuals at best."

"To begin, I will need to come up with a reading list-"

"Don't put 'A Beginner's Guide to Thermodynamics' on that list," Shuri interrupted immediately. "I've read it. It is not a guide for 'beginners'. They make far too many assumptions about prerequisite knowledge."

"You've read it already?" Markus slapped his forehead and said, "Of course you did. Nonetheless, I wasn't planning on including it. 'Principles of Thermodynamics' is more accessible for newbies in my opinion. It contains a lot of examples and questions to support each concept."

"I agree on that point," Shuri affirmed. "What about the questions to keep the discussion rolling?"

"They can't be close-ended questions that end with just the definition," Markus narrated straight out of the booklet. "And according to Master, it will be beneficial if we can somehow tie it in with magic..."

Shuri scratched her chin in thought before an idea struck her, "'Can the laws of thermodynamics be violated or circumvented? Why or why not? And if so, then how?'"

Markus pondered over the question before jotting it down. "If the laws of motion can be circumvented with magic, so can the laws of thermodynamics. The beauty comes in figuring out the right kind of 'lie' you want to tell the world."

Just like that, the duo continued their brainstorming for a decent half-an-hour. After Markus had an outline drafted, they moved on to Shuri's seminar which was decided to be on "ergonomics and its importance in design" as well as "function-over-form or form-over-function". As this topic was more open-ended, the session went on for over an hour as the duo planned out the questions and even anticipated the direction the seminar could go, devising ways to curtail irrelevant discussion avenues.

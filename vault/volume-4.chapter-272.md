"So they are the new juniors who will be joining our Sect?" Markus half-inquired-half-commented as he let his eyes scan over the timid horde of youths fidgeting uncomfortably before him. His question was directed towards his Master, while the comment addressed the congregation with an evaluating intonation. He couldn't help a doubtful expression from marring his otherwise unaffected face.

"That's all of them, alright!" His Master affirmed with a satisfied smile. "Take good care of them. Make sure they are registered and are intimated with the contract they need to sign. Amongst them, there are a few who haven't been trained to read and writem, so you will have to assist them in going through the Sect's expectations and what they can expect from the Sect."

Markus nodded in response, but there was a tinge of apprehension in his movement. He hummed aloud and looked towards his Master with a meaningful gaze. He leaned closer and probed, "Are you sure about this, Master?"

"They are eager to join, and more than willing to learn along with us," Guy emphasised, though he could see that his Disciple still wasn't convinced. "You've fallen into the classical trap of pre-judging someone before even getting to know them."

Guy tilted his head towards the youths and said, "They're good kids who've just managed to get out of a tough point in their lives. They are in dire need of help, and it is within our capacity to offer it."

"And haven't I already told you this: it doesn't matter who joins the Sect, or how capable they are, as long as their heart and minds are in the right place," Guy highlighted. "I know where your scepticism is rooted, but I can assure you that your fears are unwarranted. I didn't choose them as backups because I had no other choice. I am genuinely interested in having them be a part of the True World Sect."

Markus followed his Master's retreating back as it exited the room. He then turned back to face his potential juniors once again and scanned them more thoroughly. His gaze pierced through them, causing a few to shudder in discomfort, until it stopped at a boy standing up front.

"Your eyes..." Markus muttered in a barely audible tone.

"They were taken from me," the boy answered. "But Sect Leader is a benevolent man. He has help bring justice to the perpetrators who did this to me. I and forever in his debt!"

Markus revealed a faint smile at that. Nothing warmed his heart more than seeing his Master recieve the recognition he deserved.

'They've suffered a lot,' he surmised. 'Thus they know the harsh reality of the world we live in. They will be perfect'

The quarantine encompassed a large region between a Duchy and two of its neighbouring Marches. Within it, there were multiple villages and a township that stood as a key trading hub. Unfortunately, because of the epidemic and the subsequent collapse of the economy, the entire region was closed off and effectively excised from the trade links. This should have affected the Duchy and Marches greatly, and it did, but unlike businesses, Clans ran their profit-loss analysis in years to decades, rather than months to years. After all, once all the sick and infected were gone (which should take about six months through some estimates), this area would be free to use once again. Furthermore, there was never a shortage of people in this world.

Jean wasn't willing to subscribe to this line of thinking. Which was also why she was here, fitting herself into a puffy and uncomfortable personal protective equipment.

"You should also wear yours," Jean said to Josie, who was trying her hardest to suppress her laughter. The outfit was a full bodysuit that went over regular clothing, with strings wrapping around cuffs of each appendage and hood to tighten and tie so that nothing goes in. A mask of similar gauzy material was wrapped around Jean's face, with a glass mask over her eyes.

"This slave does not need it, Young Miss," Josie responded with a bow, less to be respectful, more to hide the rising corners of her lips.

"It's not for you, it's for others. As long as we cover ourselves, we limit the chances of the illness nesting itself within our clothes. Its easier dispose of this that our clothes!" Jean reminded. An extended, stern stare down later, Josie found herself hugged by a garish white and gauzy outerwear with all facial protection, just like her Young Mistress.

The duo trudged through the sparse forestry for an hour before they stumbled upon the first sign of possible human habitation - a dilapidated village. The place looked like a ghost-town with it collapsed or half-broken homes, and overall eerie atmosphere. Clearly, this place was only a settlement in name as its inhabitants had long since abandoned it. This was further corroborated when their sights fell on the burnt-to-a-crisp and charred mountain of corpses at the village's centre.

"Do you think they did this after they died or before?" Jean muttered in disbelief.

"We can only hope that it was after. To be burnt alive... Maybe it was a better release than the inhumane death the disease offered?" Josie theorised.

"Do you sense any living beings here?" Jean inquired. Josie extended her mana sense and zoomed through the village's perimiter.

"None that are human. Though these rats sure are making my time harder," Josie grunted as she fired a razor of wind towards a congregation of large black rats fighting over a chunk of flesh that barely resembled an ear. The spell hit the congregation and shredded them until they were all turned into an explosion of blood and gore.

"Was that necessary?" Jean groaned.

"Filthy creatures!" Josie spat in disgust, not bothering to hide her clear disgust of the rodents.

Jean shook her head and moved through the village in search of anything pertinent to her healing pursuits. Sadly, the whole place had been ransacked by its previous inhabitants, leaving nothing for Jean to use to make any deductions.

With that, the duo moved one. They navigated in a counterclockwise path, moving progressively inwards with each circulation. They managed to find another village in their trajectory, but this one was also completely abandoned. This one, however, did not practise the method of burning away the dead bodies. Instead, the corpses remained, let to rot. These emaciated, rotted and half-eaten corpses were covered in black pus oozing out of the grape sized boils.

Josie scrunched her face at this ghastly visual and proceeded to cremate the bodies, barring two that appeared recently deceased. Jean separated these two bodies and proceeded to take samples of the fluid stored in the boils and ran a thorough inspection of the deceased's condition at time of death. After an external check, she charged mana at the tip of her index and middle-finger and performed a large Y-incision, spanning shoulder to shoulder and chest to abdomen.

"The heart has necrotised completely, even before death! The other organs have varying degrees of necrotic tissue," Jean exclaimed. "The disease targets the heart first."

"Should I conduct an autopsy on the brain as well?" Jean questioned while turning towards Josie, who flicked her finger and exploded another horde of rats swarming on a corpse.

"Filthy creatures!" Josie spat venomously. "It is not necessary. I can sense that the brain is sufficiently unaffected by the illness from here. Besides, we should at least honour these bodies with an intact mien for their funeral, even if it is delayed."

Josie moved the bodies remotely and lit a burgeoning pyre to consume them. While the pyre bloomed, she diverted her gaze once again and started to explore more rodents that entered her line of sight. At one point, she pointed at an empty field and cast a quick spell causing a small explosion of dust and gore (apparently a rat had hidden itself underground).

Turning her head, Josie noticed that Jean was looking at her pointedly. "Something you want to talk about?" Jean probed. It was clear that Josie nursed some sort of grudge with rats in general.

Josie looked at the girl's face, which was unperturbed but held eyes that were eking concern. After a second of thought, she released a sigh and

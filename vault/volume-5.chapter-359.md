- The group gets brought in front of Guy.

- They run tests to see what all Revian can see with his new sight:
    - It is found to be an unlocked feature in his mana sense.
    - Mages naturally gain this power in higher realms, to see the amount of mana being used, but it is through instinct. For Revian, this is more quantified.
    - Limits:
        - Cannot see if another's mana sense is blocking his view.
        - People at higher realms and with more control over their mana can fool you as well.

- Since this is basically something is known, but not quantified, there is little effect to cultivation.

- Test of repeatability. Guy decided to stick around when they start testing out with Kevan.

- Kevan also ends up getting this ability, but much faster as he has Revian's notes to help guide his observation.

- Casey and Lacey achieve success next

- While the results of the experiment gets immortalised in the Sect's library as well as in Guy's Church of the True World, Revian moves on to implement his own experiment: Disproving the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

The sunlight bore down on the Palace of the Sun with heightened intensity bringing warmth and illuminating everything the rays kissed - all except for one particular courtyard of the extended wing which was drenched in dreary shadows borne of overgrown shrubbery. The garden of this courtyard was unkempt, suffering from years of neglect and avoidance and had risen to blanket the only building positioned in the vicinity completely... or at least that was how it was supposed to appear. If one took the time to really evaluate the scenery, they would observe that the choice of flora in the garden was focused toward concealment.

The Sun-Sapping Creeper, a plant bordering upon the classification of a parasite that thirsts endlessly for sunlight. It finds support on large trees and structures, clambering up them towards the sun. Upon success, they then spread out endlessly in all directions ensuring that maximum surface area is exposed to the sunlight, often relying on and extracting the nutrients drawn in by the trees they use for support, draining them to a sliver of their lives and just strong enough to support the creepers. As the creepers spread, they blot out the sun, disallowing its rays to reach the ground below. The Sun-Sapping Creeper is notoriously quick to grow and proliferate, and can thrive for a very long time in a myriad of environments. It was this exact creeper that blanketed the entirety of the courtyard and its garden, effectively shrouding the yard and evoking a sense of dread and despair.

Even the plethora of maids and eunuchs that swarmed accross the palace grounds passively avoided the 'Haunted Courtyard'. Rumour went that the previous occupant of the court still haunted the gardens. She was a Concubine brought in from a niche Clan - which was just another way of saying that she was a hostage held by the Emperor to keep a small but powerful Clan in check. She was the bargaining chip the Clan handed to the Crown so that they could protect their lineage. Except she wasn't complicit to the exchange. She hated every minute of it. She hated her Clan for voluntarily sending her to the chopping block, she hated the man who ripped her away from her family and forced himself on her, she hated everything and everyone.

Not many maids and eunuchs last in the Inner Palace to die of old age. The air in these grounds is charged with venom that can steal one's life without warning. No one is safe here as even the most innocent of bystanders can unwittingly become complicit to a heinous plot to murder a little prince for no reason but to remove a valuable piece from the gameboard. However, of those sly of mind and gifted with infalliable survival instincts can attest of the maddness that befell the original occupant of the Haunted Courtyard.

Hatred is a destructive emotion, unfortunately the Concubine who lived in the Haunted Courtyard was brimming with it. The maids who catered to her and still lived to date could attest to the many treasonous words that rolled off of the woman's tongue when behind closed doors. They could attest, after days of endless and bone-rattling torture of course, to the sheer vitriol oozing from the woman at every point in time at the thought of her Clan, the Emperor and to an extent even herself. Over the years, her hatred had seeped into her bones and following her demise her soul which was bathed in this hatred had turned into a grudge and patrolled her courtyard... probably.

Of course, the servants assigned to the desceased Concubine would readily attest that the woman was deeply affectionate with regards to one person, and one person alone. Said person was now the sole occupant of the Haunted Courtyard and their

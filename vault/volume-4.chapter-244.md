Before the sun could breach the horizon and proclaim the start of a new day, individuals accross the capital rose and prepared themselves for an event that would rattle the martial topography of the Solar Empire for the coming decade. Today was the start of the Conference of the Solar Sect Alliance... and the Congregation of the Solar Branch of the Co-operative of Teachers.

'Now that's a mouthful,' Guy thought to himself as he observed the fluttering banner hanging above the gate leading into the event hall. A crowd was just forming, as the early risers and event staff scuttled about clearing and preparing the area for the eventual arrival of the Teachers and potential students seeking patronage from those renowned personages.

The Congregation wasn't usually held at this time of the year. The Co-operative had moved it around to compete with the Sects, who had recently regained some momentum in the past years with a sudden increase in recruitment and fame. And although people respected and preferred Teachers for their accessibilty, sects were still the go-to for your average citizen to solve problems of the magical variety. After all, the nature of a Teacher was to float towards where the benefit lay, while sects were tethered to the regions they were established in.

Furthermore, the reputation of Teachers had tanked a bit more recently after the whole "Plague of Dark Cleansing" debacle. After all, the perpetrator was the cherished student of a famous Teacher - a detail the sects made a point to highlight and emphasise.

It seemed that now they were planning to go all out. Lowering the bar for taking on students, increasing the number of students per Teacher, running charitable initiatives, they were even going as far as to push forward a fresh and new face that exemplified Teachers. At that moment, the event staff unfurled another poster, revealing the so-called "new face" of the Solar Branch of the Co-operative of Teachers.

Guy nearly choked on his saliva upon seeing the familiar face with the chiselled jawline and piercing eyes staring back at him. 'Jo. Fucking. Way! Of course, it had to be him. Oh no!'

Guy's head swivelled about his neck as he searched for the bane of his existence. After ensuring that the man wasn't around, he released a sigh of relief.

'Could this have been me?' Guy wondered. 'If I hadn't quit, or if Markus' first fight hadn't been with Gaige, I would have also had to come to this event.'

Maybe he'd have achieved some success in Smithing or Enchanting and earned himself a star towards his Teaching licence and even received it amongst all the other Teachers during today's event.

'Again, no point dwelling on what could have been, when I have so many other things to worry about now,' Guy shook his head and turned around. Right opposite where the Teacher's event was being held was the location of the Sect's conference. It was literally the building on the other side of the street.

'These Teachers are not even trying to be subtle at this point. This is just petty.' Guy chuckled as he entered the gates.

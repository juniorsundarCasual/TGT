Hesitance. Second thoughts. Doubt.

In the past eight-hundred or so years, Krish never once felt those emotions. He had his life figured out. The actions he took were calculated, the risks expected, thus the consequences... well... inconsequential. It wasn't like he lives a life free of mistakes. In fact, his early years were rife with one blunder after another. Most were simply in passing, while others left lasting scars. At first, he regreted his actions and he wallowed over the repercussions. Yet over the years, he'd learned to move past them - it wasn't like he could do anything about it.

However, in the recent year, Krish found himself asking, "Did I do the right thing?" or "Was this the correct action?" a lot more... uncomfortably so. Where did all this hesitation come from?

The answer was standing right next to him, in the form of his headstrong and yet equally vulnerable Disciple. The duo set out early in the morning to the docks, a few days after the "incident", to hitch a ride on a ship headed Eastwards. In the days following the "incident", Marie had turned mum. Her gaze often veered off into the background as though it were focused on something distant and imaginary. Her face didn't betray much in terms of emotion, barring the infrequent yet imperceptible scowls, as if she had pondered upon something unpleasant.

Even with all the power in Krish's repertoire, there was little he could do to read another person's mind. His only basis of comparison was with Marie's usual temperament, which was nothing like how she was behaving at the moment. That concerned Krish a lot.

'Did I do the right thing back there?' Krish pondered. The more he revisited the events that transpired during the "incident", the more Krish felt like slapping himself. If somehow his powers granted him the ability to travel back in time, Krish would approach his past self and throttle the man to death.

'The exposure was too quick, and definitely excessive.' Marie had witnessed a child-murder, a rape, and had personally participated in torture that may have led to involuntary manslaughter.

A horse is naturally afraid of being ridden, it is in their blood. As prey animals, the feeling of having something mounting them evokes the same emotion as if it were a predator's attack. Yet horses are the preferred form of transportation. How is this possible?

In order to prepare a horse to be ridden comfortably, an experienced rider essentially mounts it forcefully. The horse follows its natural instinct to leap and buck, and tries to dismount its rider. But the rider's aim is to never let off. They must persist, until eventually the horse relents. The goal is to literally break the horse's spirit until it submits, which is where the term breaking comes from.

On paper, breaking a horse is necessary. However, only the horse knows the emotional torture it must live through to reach the optimal state of coexistance with its human masters. At least a horse is an animal with the basest of perceptiveness - the mental scars it sustains during the process fade over time as it grows accustomed to life. But that is not so with humans.

Much like how a horse is broken to be ridden, a mage must be broken to take a life. People aren't naturally predisposed to take another human's life, since there is no natural benefit from doing so. Killing for self-defence is acceptable, killing to protect something valuable a little less so but still within the bounds of acceptability. However, killing someone in cold-blood or in a fit of passion causes something to snap inside any sane and functioning human. An immense revulsion boils over from within and threatens to evacuate from the only avenue available. This may happen once, it may happen twice, but eventually, the visceral reaction ceases altogether. That is the sign that the person had grown accustomed to taking a life. They are thus broken.

People, once broken, either remain broken or are rebuilt. However, just like any piece of ceramic, once they are shattered no amount of adhesive can get rid of the cracks. Even with the strongest of glues, the crack lines will remain the first point of failure under any application of excessive force.

Krish's Master broke him in very early, maybe a year earlier than Marie's current age. The man had actually engineered a scenario to force Krish's hand to kill someone. Worse yet, it was Krish's childhood friend. Krish didn't know that the confrontation that resulted in his friend's death was the result of his Master's machinations until much, much later, when his Master was in his deathbed. At that time, Krish had already forgotten or overwritten that incident in his memories as a little short of a millennium had passed since then.

For a long time, Krish figured that it was the optimal path - that his Master had done the right, albeit horrible thing. Yet within the last year, Krish had come to question his Master's methods in more ways than one. Especially now as he saw Marie absent-mindedly board the ship which would be their rides.

Krish knew that he would have to break Marie in eventually. The path of a Mage was wraught with dangers, and queasiness towards killing would only end up getting her killed. However, Krish did not want to orchestrate the procedure for Marie like his Master did to him. This was why he'd taken a hands-off approach when an opportunity presented itself, specifically in the way she handled the trio destined for death. He already saw the ending when Marie first beckoned for a ride in their cart.

It didn't take much convincing for Markus to agree to Shuri's second term and request. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't costly as compared to the first one that called for setting up a slime and wisp farm. A large scale landscaping operation would be required as the meadow entrance to the underground cavern where Fancy lived was off-limits. But the investment was worth it, and a rough financial analysis indicated that they could turn a profit within three and a half years with just Shuri harvesting the mana cores.

In the end, this was Shuri's initiative and the responsibility fell on her to come up with a plan for the entire operation. She would then have to take this plan for approval from the Sect and things would move forward thusly. This itself was a heavy workload, but thankfully Marie did not pile more work on top of it.

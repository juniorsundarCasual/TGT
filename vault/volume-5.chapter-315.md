It didn't take much convincing for Markus to agree to Shuri's second term and request. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't costly as compared to the first one that called for setting up a slime and wisp farm. A large scale landscaping operation would be required as the meadow entrance to the underground cavern where Fancy lived was off-limits. But the investment was worth it, and a rough financial analysis indicated that they could turn a profit within three and a half years with just Shuri harvesting the mana cores.

In the end, this was Shuri's initiative and the responsibility fell on her to come up with a plan for the entire operation. She would then have to take this plan for approval from the Sect and things would move forward thusly. This itself was a heavy workload, but thankfully as Marie promised, the transition into the Innovator Track greatly reduced her workload in the research assistantship - she was now back to a single stack.

Shuri wasn't sure if she should be grateful for the reversion, as she kept getting this feeling that she was somehow tricked into her current position by some highly tactful manoeuvring on Marie's part. Ultimately, it was only an itchy feeling at the back of her mind telling her that she had somehow walking into a trap. But, Shuri was too far gone that turning back was no longer an option.

Coming up with a feasible landscaping plan was tough. Shuri didn't know where to begin. After multiple field inspection trips, which mostly involved moving in large circles and pulsing her mana sense under her feet, she managed to narrow down a suitable location where the digging could begin to tap into the cavern underneath the mountain. Compared to the accessible opening in the hidden meadow, this one would require some heavy-duty work that would move a lot of earth around. It wasn't something that mortal labourers could achieve within the time limit she set for herself.

So, Shuri made a tricky decision and started to recruit help from her peers. Luckily they were only kids with little training in political social engineering such as herself. A few trades here and promises to tutor them there later, Shuri had a veritable horde of magically capable labourers.

Shuri furnished her workers with a modified |Earth Shift| spell that could compound when a target is hit by multiple casters at the same time. She created this spell with the help of the Modular Spellmaking Guide and Spell Circle Compartmentalisation Paper from the advanced course material. She had to admit that the Sect's approach towards spell-casting was incredibly intuitive and efficient. She never that it was possible to break down the arcane magical concepts that were steeped in subjectivity down to a science.

After the project was approved, Shuri worked as the foreman and guided the teens in moving the earth and rocks to form a narrow and spiralling passageway underground to the approximate depth of the cavern. From that point, then built a tunnel the moved in the meadow's general direction. While this sounded simple on paper, it was far from it. Shuri learned, both through experience and subsequent heavy reading, that cave-ins and tunnel collapses were a thing if there was no support structure in place. Luckily the first collapse didn't hurt anyone, or else she would have to submit another hefty accident report and await further evaluation and worse yet, attract the Sect Leader's attention.

But a single mistake was enough for Shuri to learn. And from that point onwards, she decided to take a less hurried path and approached Markus for some advice.

"When you started to get all the sect members involved in your project, while I was happy that you were finally socialising, I was worried that you would end up hurting people in your zeal," Markus said with a relieved sigh. "While it is good to be confident in oneself, it is often superior to accept one's shortcomings and ask for help especially if failure leads to catastrophe."

Shuri bit her lips to cover her irritation. "You were aware that I would fail, and yet you approved the landscaping plan?"

Markus nodded with a distressed smile, "I wanted to try something out."

"Are you kidding? People would have got hurt!" Shuri exclaimed with an enraged growl.

"So you do care about your fellow members," Markus highlighted with a suspicious tilt of his head.

"What do you mean?" Shuri pressed the brake on her emotions and doubled back.

"I mean, the others may not see it, but it is obvious that you were taking advantage of your peers to get them to volunteer for you," Markus pointed out. "Although you didn't put them at a loss, it wasn't a nice thing to do. You could just ask them for help, you know?"

Shuri swallowed a gulp while her back started to become wet with a layer of cold sweat. She was caught. Her subtle maneouvring had failed!

Back in the Palace, Shuri was an inconsequential presence. She would face disdain and discrimination from her "siblings" and the Emperor's many concubines, but it was only in passing when she happened to cross their path. They never actively sought to bully her as she meant nothing in the grand game. Because of that, Shuri managed to get away with a lot of minor politicking to cover her ass. However, the True World Sect was different. Here, the environment wasn't actively adversarial, nor was she an inconsequential presence. She was under active monitoring by everyone, and so her usual strategy got her caught!

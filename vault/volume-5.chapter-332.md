Jean read through the letter Marie had penned for her once again, making it the tenth time she'd read it. She didn't hope that the words written within would magically change with each new read. And it wasn't that she didn't understand what the letter intended.

The reason for her obsession with the text was because it brought into question something that made her rethink her entire journey up until this point: whether it was all a result of the efforts of herself and those around her or if it was something that was predetermined?

Predetermination is an interesting concept. It states that whatever has happened, is happening and will happen is already decided. Was Jean's breakthrough as a mage an event which was predetermined? Was Jean never supposed to have the sole capacity to counter the Plague Emperor's Plague of Dark Cleansing? Was everything she'd done and achieved till now an eventuality regardless of her efforts?

Of course that wasn't true! If Jean hadn't put the effort, she wouldn't have achieved the successes she's gained till this point. But the fact remained that there was really no way around it. The decisions Jean made and the actions she took were a direct result of her character. And the only way to go around that would be to do something that was out of character, willingly. Why would anyone do that?

People behave and act a certain way because they are born that way and are later affected by the environment that urges a change. People cannot control the conditions of their birth, nor can they control how the environment affects their lives. In many ways, people are living reactive lives and the way they react is a function of the life they have lived till that point.

"In the end, free will is just an illusion," Jean concluded. "I can do what I want, but what I want is a result of who I am. And who I am is not really something I have control over."

It was a sobering realisation. And to think that a simple letter written for a little girl could incite such deep and reality shattering thoughts!

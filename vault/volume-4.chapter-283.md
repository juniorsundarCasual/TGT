Jean's perception of time reached a complete standstill. A single second extended to encompass a lifetime, as her brain struggled to process what had just occurred. With every plan, there is a worst case scenario that everyone seeks to avoid, and the catastrophic case that everyone fails to predict. This was a disaster packaged inside a catastrophe served in a platter of misfortune.

This was not supposed to happen.

Jean's vision started to warp. The visage of the girl drenched in blood started to undulate and shift grotesquely. It bubbled for a while before settling into the image of herself when she was younger. The girl's face grew sinister as a ghastly smile split the crimson-soaked face in half.

#Another one dead by your own incompetence,# the girl said in a raspy voice.

#How many more need to die before you realise that it was you all along?# Her voice grew with a brain-splitting crescendo.

#You're the problem!# The girl reached forward, her petite hands curled slightly as they approached Jean's neck.

#The solution is obvious, if you think about it,# her hands grasped Jean's neck and started to tighten.

#You. Must. Die!# Jean's breath grew more difficult.

#Die!# Suffocation.

#DIE!#

#DIE!#

Jean's sight grew darker, as her consciousness started to waver. Her body refused to respond to the girl's death grip, or maybe her mind refused to act against it. Maybe this was meant to be. The girl was right; she was the problem. Maybe-

"Hello?" A gentle shake broke through the defeatist din pervading Jean's mind.

"Hello?" It repeated. The voice was dainty and mellow. It cut past all the negativity, and brought Jean's vision back online. Jean realised that she was sweating excessively, something which hadn't happened for a very long time (even less so after advancing in her cultivation).

"Helloooo?" Jean followed the call and was jolted once again by the garish image of a girl drowning in blood. Now that her mind was clearer, Jean went to action immediately. She had to first separate the man exhibiting symptoms from this tent, she also had to do the same with the drenched girl (after running some tests with her first). So, she recruited the girl's help to move the man using a stretcher. Thankfully, everyone else in the tent kept a respectable distance from them, since they were now educated in the disease's mode of transmission. Once the man was settled, she administered a dosage of painkiller to assuage him for a while, since that was all she could do for now.

After that quick detour, Jean dragged the girl into the research tent and proceeded to clean her thoroughly with soap and disinfectant. When Jean scrubbed the area under the girl's shoulders, the girl released an elated giggle that finally brought some brightness into the girls dull and morose face.

"Hold still," Jean said while she dabbed the girl's hair. The girl listened, but then Jean could suddenly hear whimpers and moans escaping from under the rag.

"Hey? Are you okay?" Jean removed the towel and saw the girl crying terribly. "Hey! It's okay... It's okay..."

Jean pulled the girl into a tight embrace and let her release all the pent-up sorrow.

"I-I killed her.... I k-killed her," the girl muttered between fitful breaths. "I s-shouldn't have played in the woods like my mother warned me to."

"And now... now... she's gone!" The girl's voice grew louder, and her cries grew more primal.

"It's not your fault," Jean said in a hushed tone. "It's not your fault Kili."

"I k-killed her-"

"Look at me!" Jean pulled the girl away and shook her jerkily. The girl's cries halted due to the sudden shock. With a serious frown, Jean repeated, "It is not your fault! Do you hear me?"

The girl nodded hastily, half in fear and half in agreement. At that moment, Jean realised that she'd outwardly exhibited irritation, anger and frustration - another peculiarity.

Rather that wasting anymore time, Jean quickly conjured a spell circle that produced a continuous gust of warm wind to blow dry the girl's hair.

"Dress up and meet me in the lab. I have to perform my rounds through the tents once again and distribute rations," she said before leaving the girl by herself.

"You don't have to follow us, you know?" Markus said casually to Dora, who was walking beside him and struggling to keep up with the pace of the group of five consisting of Revian, Kevan, Casey, Lacey and Markus.

"I have to go meet Fancy anyways - it's been some time since we last talked," Dora said between breaths while waving her hand dismissively. "She said she was going to be busy growing, or something like that. She went into her tree and hasn't come out since then."

"Are you sure that she is okay?" Markus probed. "Marie told me that the creat-"

He held back his words as Dora gave him an enraged glare. "I mean- Marie told me that Fancy underwent some unknown fusion-evolution."

"You know what's weird?" Dora responded with a high pitch. "I don't even remember that happening. One second, I was looking one part of the meadow completely wrecked and Fancy dying, and the next thing I knew, I was looking at a completely different Fancy who was completely fine."

"You did something, how do you not remember?" Markus responded in disbelief.

"I don't know," Dora shrugged while continuing the trek.

"And that doesn't bother you?"

"Whatever happened saved Fancy," Dora answered matter-of-factly. "Who cares what it was."

Markus wanted to argue against that point, saying, 'What if whatever happened has some negative consequences of the line?'

But then he didn't because he realised Dora wasn't old enough to understand what "far-reaching consequences" are. Actions have consequences, some are immediate, others are more distant and vaguer. People make decisions based on a set window of time within which their actions yields a particular consequence. Maturity is the process by which this time window grows large enough to encompass your entire lifetime.

Dora's time window was short, which was fine. Markus did not want his younger sister to mature too early like he and Marie did. After all, living in ignorance was a gift only afforded by children.

"Well, try not to disturb them," Markus warned while picking the panting girl and placing her on his shoulder. "They are about to do something dangerous, so let's not make it harder for them than it already is."

Dora nodded with a serious expression and dragged her pinched index and thumb over her lips, "My lips are sealed!"

Markus let out a light chuckle and followed the quartet of investigators walking with both excitement and hesitation. He could feel the palpable tension growing on them with each step forward. It was the anticipation and expectation of what was to come.

At this moment, only a single thought - a question - swam in their heads: "Will the experiment succeed or will it fail?"

As such, Markus didn't feel the same level of pressure in anticipation, because he had a gist of how the experiment would turn out. After living and working closely with Marie, he'd learned how to decrypt her cryptic words. Things that were said in passing held meaning. Things that sounded simple and straightforward, often weren't. And things that were important and emphasised... well, they were important!

Luckily, this skill also extended to the words spoken by her Master who, thankfully, wasn't so annoyingly cryptic as she was. Her Master said that the experiment wouldn't fail as long as the quartet stuck to their safety procedures to the letter. While this wasn't an explicit indication of whether the experiment was successful or not, it did carry one key meaning. If the experiment wasn't going to fail then they were certain to get some kind of meaningful result. Even if the result wasn't a success, but a dud, it would be a learning experience.

Of course, no one WANTS their experiment to not yield anything - it is only natural.

A few minutes later, the group arrived at a familiar location in forest, at which point Dora swiftly leapt off of Markus' shoulder and rushed forward.

As she crossed an imaginary threshold, Dora vanished like smoke in air.

"So this is the place?" Revian turned and asked Markus, looking for confirmation. Responding with a firm nod, Markus walked onwards and followed Dora through the imaginary threshold.

The scene before him crumbled like powdery snow, and the previously dense shrubbery dispersed to show a beautiful meadow sprawling with flowers of various shape, size and colours. At the centre of the meadow, which rose like a small hill, stood an intimidating tree that appeared hollow and porous with large holes dotting every visible section of its bark. Surprisingly though, there was an eerie darkness inside that set-off alarm bells across Markus' spine.

Dora, though, was not hindered by the creepy tree and skipped towards it eagerly, while calling out, "Fancy! I'm back!"

Markus stopped the urge to pull the girl back, trusting the fact (against his better judgement) that the creature within wouldn't hurt her. Thankfully, the creature did not show itself no matter how much Dora called out its name. After making sure that the coast was clear, he edged closer to his disappointed sibling and pulled her close into a consoling hug.

By this time, the quarter outside the illusory meadow had passed the barrier and entered the vibrant field.

""Wow"" The twins evoked in a tone overflowing with enamoured awe.

The boys were however drawn to the

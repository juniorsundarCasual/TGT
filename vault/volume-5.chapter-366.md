Seven teens sat awkwardly in a line with their heads lowered and hands placed squarely on their laps. Their appearance was haggard, as though they had just come out of a tussle.

"I cannot believe I'm forced to have this conversation," Guy's steely voice boomed as the door to the room swung open, and he strode in with forceful steps. "A fisticuff within the True World Sect - I thought I taught you all to be more civilised than this!"

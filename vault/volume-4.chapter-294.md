The disparity in strength, though not so evident at first, grew increasingly obvious with the passing of time and with every successful attack. It was an expected outcome, after all, since the two derived their newfound strength from two starkly different sources.

The figure in light took her strength from the antibodies coursing through Jean's body. In understanding and deciphering the way they worked, she pushed her affinity towards life and healing. The figure in dark used the cultivation borne of the Rat King, which was already matured and interpreted through the creature's short yet eventful life. The concepts of pestilence that prevailed in its cultivation helped push her affinity towards death and disease.

#Useless!# A heavy fist coated in a deathly mist hit the other woman square in her jaw. Her pristine and serene appearance had grown ragged and near death. Though technically no blood was being spilt, the entity on the losing end looked like she was on her last limb.

#Just!# Punch. #LET!# Punch. #GO!#

The woman coiled her arm and ejected a roundhouse elbow that cracked against her kneeling opponent's skull. In turn, the woman in white spun and fell onto the ground with a gruesome bounce.

#You presence is no longer needed,# the woman in the black mist mocked with a cheerful grin while approaching her opponent. #But fret not. Your contribution will go a long way towards our future.#

She licked her lips in bliss as she grasped the white woman by her skull and proceeded to thrust her thumbs into the woman's eye-sockets. She looked towards the trembling little girl and chuckled with malicious glee. Slowly, the white woman's body started to disperse and turn into gas that was inhaled voraciously by the woman in black.

The little girl collapsed as the thought of her imminent demise registered within her mind. There could only be one - it would either be the gigantic woman with black mist adorning her form, or her measly self - and the odds did not seem to be in her favour.

At that moment, the area between the girl and the feasting giant rippled. From nothingness, a personal, circular portal materialised. Through it, a person familiar to the little girl stepped out. Just as it came, the portal disappeared after replenishing the number of live persons within the area back to three.

"Jean," Mister Larks greeted the little girl with unparalleled surety.

"And you must be the interloper causing grief to one of my dearest pupils," he derided after turning towards the much larger entity.

The giantess moved into action almost immediately. Her fist coated in death and disease hurtled at Mach speeds towards the new Sect Leader. The little girl wished to do something, but her body refused to yield to any of her demands.

"Stop," a muted voice escaped from Mister Larks' mouth. The girl could not hear it, but the lip movements were easy enough to translate. With unparalleled obedience, the attacking giantess ceased and froze almost immediately.

"Now, my child. Why would you take such an action and perform such a blunder upon yourself?" Mister Larks gently chided.

"I-I-"

"That's right. You weren't thinking," Mister Larks declared with a tired sigh. "I hope you realise that you have but yourself in a very difficult situation. This one here-" he said while nudging his chin towards the frozen giantess, '-Is going to wake up and now definitely eat us all (unless she wasn't already planning to do that.)"



I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:

I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.

I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.

I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.

I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.

I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.

I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.

I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.

I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.

Finally, and above all else, I will first do no harm.

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

Yohn and Markus proceeded to build the spark-gap transmitter according to the blueprint and descriptions, which wasn't an easy matter. While the concepts involved in the device made sense, it was the construction and components that posed a problem for the duo since they called for a level of industrial development that the world hadn't reached yet. In fact, they lived in a world where electricity hadn't even been developed. So, for all intents and purposes, they were working with highly advanced technology.

Of course, the knowledge of electricity and its applications was known to all Sect members. But to them, electricity was closer to magic than science. Who could truly fathom the possibility of being able to light up an entire city like a bouquet of flowers, when the only sights they have been exposed to are oil lanterns? Yet this world did have magic, which made digesting the incredibility of electricity easier. And Sect Leader Larks did run a few experiments of generating current using a simple generator (by spinning a magnet between a coil of wire) to show that electricity wasn't made by magic. But ultimately, electricity was still just a scientific curiosity. To put it into effect as an essential tool for mankind's rise to power, there were still a lot of steps left.

But Markus and Yohn couldn't wait for technology to catch up to that point. They needed to harness electricity now. But, without applicable intimacy with the subject, the two realised that they were nothing short of blind mice stumbling about in search of food with only a faint scent hanging in the air to guide them. Ultimately, Markus decided that, after spending three days of achieving diddly-squat, to just ask his Master for help.

"Why in the world are you two trying to make this monstrosity?" Master Larks said with a humorous snort. "We're trying to generate a radio wave. This was the only thing I could find in the library that made sense to me. Everything else was too hard," Markus admitted.

"If it is just a radio wave you want to generate, there are much simpler experiments," Master Larks explained. "It's good that you came to me with this. Though I have to ask, why are we jumping so far ahead in our studies? There is a reason why I have only hinted at some topics and not delved too deep into them. We just don't have the infrastructure to verify them. Some of this isn't even achievable yet."

At that instant, Yohn raised his hand meekly, causing the attention in the room to be drawn to him. "Sir, I disagree with that."

"You disagree?" Sect Leader Larks repeated with an interested quirk of a brow. "On what part?"

"That just because we lack the infrastructure written in the background of a topic, that it is out of reach," Yohn expounded while trying to control the stammer in his voice.

"I-I'd like to point out just what Senior Sister Shuri has achieved," Yohn clarified. "I've checked books in the library that have hinted at what she is doing right now, which is far ahead of the level of technology we are at now."

There was a tense silence as the Sect Leader looked pensively at Yohn, causing the boy to shift uncomfortably. Even though he could not see, he could feel the heavy gaze on him. At that moment, Markus quickly cut in.

"I think what Yohn is trying to say, Master," he started with a shaky smile, "is that maybe if we also marry magic into what we are learning, all these impossible feats of technology may be achievable."

He then leaned closer and whisper, "I apologise, but I shared the detail about your inheritance with "

The carriage jerked violently once again, causing the sole passenger to get squished amidst the mountain of cargo. Shuri cursed her poor luck silently before crawling around the precarious stack of wooden crates. It did not help that she was still reeling from the rude awakening from an unpleasant dream.

"I-Is something wrong?" Shuri asked the carriage driver through an opening in the carriage's frontal walls. This was her first time hitch-hiking and it wasn't a pleasant experience at all!

"Sorry 'bout that, miss," the man responded respectfully. "The main road's a bit crowded given the whole debacle at the Capital. Thought about taking a shortcut."

Shuri had paid the man upfront with half of her savings to hitch this ride. This amount was unregistered with the company the man ran the caravan under, thus the money would go directly into his pockets. This was why the man spoke so reverently to her.

Due to the "Terrorist Attack" that took place at the Capital, a mass exodus of people started to take place. Those swarming away from the Capital were mostly those that came there on a temporary basis: businesses and representative, event-goers, visitors and tourists. The Capital's security didn't bother hindering this outflow as the culprit behind the attack was eliminated. Furthermore, the Capital was always looking for any excuse to reduce its population.

This was perfect for Shuri as she found an abundance of choices for her prospective ride towards freedom. She eliminated all the big players such as the national-level businesses and escort processions for clans (not that she could get in with them anyway since their kind rarely obliged a hanger-on).

After careful evaluation, she settled on this man whose name she did not ask, who worked or did not work for a company she cared not to know, who had or did not have a family that she didn't wish to find out about. She did not tell him about herself either as she did not want the man to remember her - names give form to a person. If someone doesn't attach a name to an individual, they will gradually forget or overwrite the individual's existence in their memory. She submitted a substantial amount of money for his silence and discretion, which he accepted readily and maintained religiously.

"I thought we were going Northwards?" Shuri inquired upon noticing the rising sun beating down through the gap.

"My sources say that the paths through the Rasmus March has suddenly become safer. This is a lesser known trail that will connect us to the March's highway. It passes through a forest, so please brace yourself, miss," the man answered.

"Is this safe?"

"It's perfectly safe. I've taken this route many times," the man said casually with a wave of his palm.

Shuri hummed in acceptance, though the scepticism did not leave her face. An eerie sense of foreboding pervaded her thoughts as the surrounding treeline grew taller and closer. She instinctively reached for her pendant and rubbed it anxiously. 

It wasn't often that Shuri dreamed of her mother. Those memories were vivid just like everything else she experienced in her life, but they were unpleasant to say the least. She tried her hardest to suppress them, but once in a while something would sneak its way through her fortress of a mind. Whenever it did, something bad always followed.

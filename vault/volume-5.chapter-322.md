Shuri gulped audibly as she stared at the plain metal gates that separated the general and the restricted section. The keys to the ignoble lock hanging under the door handle felt like they were made of lead. This was what she wanted all along, which was to have access to everything the Sect had to offer, take advantage of it and then leave. But the circumstances were wildly against her favour. She was bound to this Sect now and was beholden to it. She could no longer leave.

"What is he thinking?" Shuri murmured out loud. The parchment filled with names of literature for her to read was in her left hand. According to the Sect Leader, it was supposed to contain information that would help her in fleshing out her knowledge of Automagy and assist her cultivation. But she highly doubted that to be true. She doubted that there would ever be another source of information about the subject that would be more detailed and practical than the notes passed on by the Yoruz Clan. But an order was an order, and if this order would let her dally around a little bit and help avert some of the heat she had brought upon herself, she was all for it. If she could prove that there was no progress to be made with this line of study, she would be eventually forgotten... right?

"Oh, who am I kidding?!" She exclaimed. Ultimately, Shuri decided to bury that hope six-feet underground. She unfurled the parchment and read through its contents thoroughly.

"Advanced Linear Algebra."

"Control Systems and Automation."

"Electronic and Mechanical Microsystems."

"Probabilistic Robotics."

"Artificial Neural Networks."

"Machine Learning."

...

"What is all this?!" Shuri blurted out. Of all the books in the list, she only knew of the first one which happened to be a rather heavy read on the advanced applications of linear algebra. She could recite the text by heart, straight from memory, but she could only attest to know the first 20% of it. As for the rest of the books, the titles themselves spoke of arcane topics she never even heard of.

This revelation gave Shuri some pause. She was now reconsidering the option of entering the restricted section. The implied knowledge carried with it the same stench that hung in the air within the Inner Palace. These were things that one shouldn't know - in other words, forbidden knowledge. This was exacerbated by the fact that Marie probably had something to do with this.

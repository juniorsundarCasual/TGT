Arriving at the capital. Long line. The Cooperative of Teachers set-up a tournament and selection to compete with the Sects.

It isn't really a big issue, since those that want to join sects WILL join sects. Only affects those on the fence.

A week remains till the official start of the event, so Guy goes sightseeing with the kids.

The City is large. It would be impossible to visit all the important locations within one day. After booking a room with an affordable tavern, the group moved through different wings of the Capital.

The Inn is in one of the older parts.

Event itinerary:
 - Registration

 - Sect Presentation/Sparring Matches
 - Sect Recruitment

During the recruitment process, the events during the start of the Volume take place.

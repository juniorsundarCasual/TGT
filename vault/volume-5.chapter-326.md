Most crafts and trade are passed down from one generation to the next through a master-apprentice relationship. A master - someone with years of experience and skill in their repertoire from practising their trade or craft - takes in an apprentice - a novice looking to start out in the trade or craft. The apprentice lives with and works under the masters, starting out with menial tasks until enough time has passed for the master to gain confidence and trust in his apprentice. Once that stage is reached, the apprentice's workload will involve more hands-on work as they begin to absorb the knowledge from their masters.

Naturally, all things must have a conclusion. An apprentice cannot remain one for their entire life. When the master deems his apprentice ready - that is when they have transferred all that can be taught - the apprentice officially graduates from their tenure under their master and sets off on a journey. You see, an apprentice who remains under the tutelage of a master becomes a copy of the master, with all the good and bad. Craftsmen and tradesmen recognise that to replicate means that their profession will never advance. Hence, an apprentice's journey acts as the catalyst of change, and the change starts with their designation: by becoming a journeyman. And thus, by working under other masters in the field, plying their trade or craft on their own, and absorbing everything the world has to offer, the journeyman grows and evolves to ultimately become a master. And thus the cycle continues.

This system also extends into the various trades and crafts under the magical banner. Apprenticeship was a common affair in the Enchanting and Smithing community, as well as the Cooking and Beast Taming crowd, although it wasn't a mandatory process. But the practise was mandatory in the Alchemical and Medicinal fields until very recently with the advent of the Guilds. The master-apprentice relationship in Alchemy and Medicine were excessively strict. Unlike others where a master could have multiple apprentices at once, an Alchemy master could only have one apprentice at a time. The same was true with master Physicians.

After an apprentice Physician has gained enough knowlege from their master, they are encouraged to set out and ply their skills in the vast and open world, as a journeyman.

On this particular day, Jean had a sudden thought as she observed her peers playing a heated game of handball.

'The amount of injuries has markedly reduced to single digits per month. As for illnesses, even since they started cultivating the occurrence of common illnesses have reduced markedly as well. As for the health of the villagers, the treatment for most if not all possible maladies and emergencies have been standardised. And we even have two trainees on standby who have been trained for emergency treatment,' Jean mentally listed. Her face started to bloom with a pleasant smile, something she just couldn't get enough of ever since the dam sequestering her emotions was demolished.

In a decisive move, Jean stood up and started to walk out of the bleachers and towards the Sect Leader's office.

"How's everything going, Jean?" Sect Leader Larks greeted as he gestured for Jean to take a seat before him.

"Everything's going well in the Sect. The most recent health inspection has shown promising results. Furthermore, the situation at the village has also improved significantly. All in all, I can say that the most recent vaccination drive has presented a marked reduction in the infection rate this flu season. Barring the mild reaction symptoms to the vaccine's antibodies, which was expected, there have been no new breakouts. However, I have found some resistance in trying to spread our vaccine in the market. The standard marketing strategies have come off as ineffective since the common-folk don't seem to understand the purpose of the vaccination and are ill-informed about the way diseases work," Jean explained.

"I expected as much. We have been successful in Twilight Village mainly because we work closely with them and have built a personal connection there. The villagers also trust us. But that cannot be assumed as true for those outside. Mortals already have a shaky relationship with sects and clans, they would take our recommendations with a grain of salt," Mister Larks affirmed. "So what is your plan?"

"I wish to go on a journey. I am currently in a special situation where there is an abundance of theoretical knowledge floating about in my head, but no outlet to apply it and internalise it for myself. I feel that by travelling around, visiting new places, and treating more people, I can build up my repertoire and become a better doctor," Jean expressed her analysis succinctly.

"You make a good point. We'll do it this way," Mister Larks retrieved a parchment from his desk and prepared his writing untensil. "The Solar Sect Alliance has amplified the scrutiny upon affiliated sect members roaming out in the world. The treaty between the Empire and the Sect Alliance has grown rather finicky, especially after our recent intervention with curing the plague. As you already know, I used my connection with the Cloudstrider Sect to mask our involvement. So on paper, it is the Cloudstrider Sect that helped clear the infestation in the region. However, the Empire decided to transfer the blame for all the damage caused in the region to the Alliance as well."

Jean furrowed her brows and asked, "How did they accomplish that? And I'm surprised the Alliance hasn't retaliated for the act of libel."

"Well it's kind of our fault, really," Mister Larks confessed with a wry smile. "The Cloudstrider Sect cannot reveal excessive details of the events lest they make our involvement known. For that reason, the Alliance has taked a hushed stance - only admitting to have solved the problem and not revealing the how and why."

"This puts us in the Cloudstrider Sect's debt," Jean admitted morosely.

"Well, this one was a freebie," Mister Larks shrugged. "Mage Glista from the Cloudstrider Sect has recently amassed quite a bit of support internally, and is now the front-runner to replace the current Sect Leader. Markus' 'defeat' against the Sect Leader's Daughter had an interesting domino effect which has now placed the Sect Leader in a shaky position."

Mister Larks then finished writing on the parchment, rolled it, and stamped the True World Sect's seal on wax.

"Sect members can roam the world - primarily in the Empire's purview - as long as they are in an affiliated sect-sanctioned mission. As someone under a sect-sanction mission, you will fall under the Alliance's agreed upon tenets when interacting with the citizens of the Empire, which includes not interfering with the Empire's and the government's initiatives," Sect Leader Larks said as he handed the roll to Jean.

"Are you planning to travel alone?" He then asked with a worried frown.

"Yes," Jean responded. "Why?"

Furion didn't expect a sidestop at the Capital on his way to the Draul Duchy down Southeast would result in forming an acquaintanceship with the Minister of Finance for the entire Empire.

What surprised him, though, was that he was already connected to the Minister through a degree of separation, namely through his son who Furion had met once before in a shareholder's meeting. Ghon was a pleasant lad to talk with - they conversed for hours on end, discussing the myriad ideas Furion wished to pursue in his business career as well as his and Sect Leader Larks' vision for the future.

"We follow a novel type of ownership model that provides limited liability to all owners of the business. By essentially listing the business as a separate entity, the owners can isolate themselves from anything they could be charged with when the business does something bad."

"I am aware of this, yes," Jing said with a hum.

"Then you must also be aware of the nature of how ownership can be obtained and traded?"

Furion received a nod from Jing.

"Well here is where I wish to apologise profusely. You see, I may have led Mister Ghon to believe that I am here to pitch you, Minister Jing, an investment opportunity. When in fact, I'm actually here to offer

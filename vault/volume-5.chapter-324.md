"The business is in a state such that it is its own entity," Ghon hinted. "The owners, which is all the shareholders, have what is known as limited liability. This means that worse comes to worst, let's say that the business suffers from bankruptcy, the owners (which are basically all the shareholders) only lose what they invested into the business and nothing more. The liability to pay back any debts stops at the business, thus ensuring that the owners are immune."

"But that is extremely risky, economically speaking. Debtors incapable of paying off their debts are turned to debt slaves to work off the overdue amount. But a business can't be turned into a debt slave, that is effectively a pit that devours money at this point!" Jing exclaimed.

"Ah, but a business isn't a human. It can be gutted for parts and sold off," Ghon rebutted. "If another investor wishes to take over, it can be handed off and start anew."

"While all of this sounds interesting, aren't we moving away from the crux of the conversation," Jing interjected while waving his hands.

"As it stands, the business model is heavily monitored in its trading. In order to facilitate a trade, the shares need to be sold to the government and then purchased from the government. As it stands, the government has the power to, to a certain extent, regulate the price of purchasing shares. But as you correctly predicted, there is a movement now to make the trading more public with the government acting as a barebone regulator. Now when that happens, well that is when the true fun starts," Ghon hinted.

Jing hummed audibly as he thought over his son's words.

"The government won't take a step back so easily. But I figure the allure of profits will urge the mass, including the large businesses and clans, to take action and force the government's hand," Jing narrated his thoughts out loud. "When that happens, the public will have greater power over influencing the state of the Duchy's economy. And when words spreads and this model takes hold accross the entire Empire..."

A pregnant pause took hold as nodes started to connect in Jing's mind.

"But that won't happen. No one in their right mind would just let something like that grow out of control!" Jing reasoned.

"They already have," Ghon responded with a shake of his head. "Radiant City is the first to allow regulated share trading amongst the general public without having to sell and buy from the government. Any business registered there can subscribe to this feature. Within this year, over 112 new business have spawned in the Maika Duchy, of which 45 are still functioning and 14 are generating sizeable profits and handing out dividends to the shareholders. Another interesting fact: of the 45 still functioning business, 33 were started by low-skilled labourers who were uneducated and or, in some cases, illiterate. This wouldn't have been possible before, where the barrier of entry to start your own business was skewed in favour of those with a more reputable background and higher levels of learning."

"I can't believe it..." Jing muttered.

"I do want to point out that most of the 33 functioning businesses are not majorly owned by the company's creator. The highest share ownership of th"

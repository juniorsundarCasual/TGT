Shuri controlled her shaking breath and shivering legs before hurriedly opening the door for the Sect Leader. The man who she'd been trying to avoid all this time had just graced her room. At this point, Shuri just didn't care. This was the worst case scenario- NO, there was a worse case than this which Shuri didn't even want to fathom lest that action of imagining the case itself resulted in the world conspiring against her.

"Umm, Sect Leader Larks. Greetings!" Shuri said with a low bow. Her body moved stiffly, as fear, uncertainty and doubt started to overpower her mucles.

"No need for all those formalities," Sect Leader Larks responded with a wave of his hands. "Everyone was worried when you didn't show up for dinner. Grace was just about to storm in here and throw a fit, but I managed to stop her," he added with a chuckle. He probably wanted her to chime in too, but her mind was checked out to follow blatant social cues, so what ensued was a one-sided chuckle that went on for too long turning awkward in the process. 

The Sect Leader coughed to try (and fail to) disperse the awkwardness and then raised up a covered plate in his hands to reveal her luck and dinner. He then scooted past Shuri - who had been frozen stiff, blocking the doorway - and placed it on her table. He removed the cover, to reveal a filled plate with a colourful assortment of food. "I also heard that you skipped lunch?"

"I was a bit busy," Shuri answered flatly. "My apologies."

"Don't apologise to me, it is your health that you are ruining with your carelessness," Sect Leader Larks chided. "If anyone deserves an apology it is you alone. Well I should also apologise"

He reached forward, causing Shuri to flinch. "Woah! Relax. I'm not going to hurt you."

"Okay," Shuri responded curtly before retreating a few steps. Her gaze was affixed on the man in her room, who shuffled backwards uncomfortably before finding a chair and taking a seat. He then gestured for Shuri to sit opposite him on her bed. After the two were seated, he sent an expectant gaze her way hoping that a conversation would ensue. This time, though, Shuri wasn't going to fall for the classic trap. Similar to negotiations, the person who spoke first always loses.

"So," Sect Leader Larks said, cutting the silence short before it continued on for too long. His fingers drummed Shuri's work table with a stiff rhythm, accentuating the discomfort he was feeling. "I just realised that I never really got the opportunity to have a conversation with you. An opportunity presented itself today, so I decided, why not?"

"If that is what the Sect Leader wishes," Shuri affirmed while jumping up from her bed and offering a respectful bow.

"Its not like that..." he said hurriedly while frantically shaking his hands before releasing a tired sigh.

"It seems you have a rather rigid image of myself in your mind," he continued while tilting his head backwards. "Do not be so quick to draw conclusions, Shuri. I'm a pretty chill dude!"

Shuri's gaze narrowed, 'What does his body temperature have to do with anything?'

She decided to not question the man's ramblings and nodded with a smile. Upon receiving a smile back in response, Shuri congratulated herself for deciphering the new social instance correctly and filed it into her mind for a later date.

The man then clapped his hands and exclaimed, "Umm, why don't we start with an introduction? I'll start."

"My name is Guy Larks - as you probably already know. Before I became a Sect Leader, I was a Teaching Apprentice at the Radiant Academy. I failed to meet the assessment criteria and was thus fired from my position. In the process, I was also blacklisted from the profession altogether," the Sect Leader narrated. Shuri had some doubts about the circumstances of his firing. To reach the Core Formation in one's mid-twenties isn't a trivial achievement. If he really was this capable, the Radiant Academy wouldn't have fired him.

She suspected that it may have been a result of political undercurrents. Which was another thing that stuck as weird to Shuri. Why was he so casual and nonchalant about being snubbed this way? Where was the self-respect of a Sect Leader- of a mage in the Core Formation realm?

'Is he biding his time and growing his power? Is his opponent so strong that-'

"Fortunately, I had a Disciple who cared for me. He brought me to Twilight Village. There, I met Grace and others. I founded this sect because I felt like I had a lot to contribute in this world. I also realised that the world wasn't particularly fair to the children living in it - the children who are supposed to represent the future."

Shuri had to swallow back an instinctive snort. She now realised why Markus spoke this way. 'Like Master like Disciple.'

As though he were reading her thoughts, the Sect Leader chuckled mirthfully and said, "You must be thinking that I'm being idealistic- naïve even. Well, a little bit of naïveté definitely makes your life a lot brighter. Of course, if you let it get to your head, then it turns to stupidity, and a step further, arrogance. That is the constant struggle, is it not?"

'That's a great way to get yourself killed,' Shuri thought to herself.

"Though as an adult, I can see that my enthusiasm can rub off as immaturity. But it is a matter of leading by example," Sect Leader Larks emphasised while leaning back against his chair. The hand on the table inched forward and started to roll the faintly glowing mana core back and forth. Shuri's body stiffened even more as this transpired.

"Most of the children in the Sect grew up too quickly. They never got the opportunity to experience their childhood and live a life of immaturity filled with naïveté. You see, one of the upsides of naïveté is that it helps you come up with the most extraordinary and sometimes downright impossible ideas. And children are special because impossibility isn't something that they can fathom just yet. Because of that, they are often able to achieve things that others, much older to them, deem impossible. Which is why I am striving to create an environment that urges kids to just be kids while they still have time," the Sect Leader elaborated.

"But for how long?" Shuri blurted out. The constant barrage of idealistic words accentuated by the casual fidgeting of the mana core broke through her guard. "Do you think that this Sect can survive the storms that are to come? Do you think that the de-fanged cohort of mages in name only can stand up against the assault of trained warriors?"

Just as Shuri covered her mouth with her eyes enlarged and ready to hop out of their sockets, she noticed the Sect Leader's right side twitching. His right hand, which had been fidgeting with the mana core, grabbed the ball firmly, raised it in front of his face and started to squeeze.

"Oh, but we already have!" Only the right side spoke, "The so-called mages that frolick around and flaunt their half-baked grasp of the world they live in can't even hold a candle against the might of the Truth-"

At this point, the left hand rose and covered the Sect Leader's mouth. The right brow creased in anger. And at this moment, Shuri realised, that she'd fucked up.

'So this is how I die,' Shuri cursed through gritting teeth as all of her survival alarms blared in earnest - there was an overbearing intent to maim, or possibly kill, hanging in the room. 'Why the fuck didn't I just keep my mouth shut like I always do?! Why-?'

Shuri could see the mana emanating from the Sect Leader's right side. The mana redirected and started to course through the mana core as he started to crush the ball. Suddenly, the only source of light in the room turned into a wispy, luminous ball and rushed towards the core.

In an instant, Shuri's alarms turned off completely. Her instincts were telling her that the danger had passed. Shuri started to wheeze as her hitched breathing resumed. She looked up fearfully and noticed the Sect Leader's complete attention focused on the brighter ball in his hand. 

"What is this?" He asked as he turned the ball around and used his mana senses to |Inspect|. This time, both his right and left side were cooperating. "Curious... the inscriptions on this are exquisite!"

"What does it do? Does it capture light?"

"And releases it," Shuri explained, with a tinge of pride in her voice.

The Sect Leader sent his mana through the core and saw the captured wisp escape and return to its place in the lantern hanging in the room.

"Amazing!" A magnetic laugh echoed within the room as the Sect Leader repeated the process of capture and release. "How did you make this?"

Shuri was about to answer that question, when suddenly her mind quickly pressed the brakes. She had nearly outed her entire family history.

'Once again, I let myself get caught as a result of sincere praise!' Shuri chastised herself.

"Umm, that's..."

The Sect Leader tilted his head and revealed a curious frown. "A family secret, I presume? Markus did tell me that you were a runaway. Speaking of which, should we be worried about your family? I mean, I don't mind you being here, but it should cause trouble to people who care about you."

"Luckily there are none to worry about," Shuri answered curtly, which was reciprocated with a dismayed and pitying expression from the Sect Leader. "No matter. You know what they say? Family isn't something you are born with, but something you create. Luckily for us, we have all the parts available here to make a perfect family," he said while nudging his head towards Shuri's window.

"Now, go ahead and eat. I won't take anymore of your time," the man said as he stood up to leave. He turned the ball in his hand and hummed appreciatively.

Shuri contained her happiness as the Sect Leader made his way towards the door. As he opened it and stepped out, her sprinting heart started to slow down and relax. But it was short-lived as he stopped in his tracks, slapped his forehead, turned around one last time, opened his mouth, and spoke.

"I almost forgot to congratulate you on your breakthrough just now! Good job! It seems that you have found a track of study that resonates with you. This is a monumental achievement, so please come to my office tomorrow afternoon following the morning lesson so that we can formalise the cultivation track for you," he said with a smile and with his eyes honed in on the luminous mana core on Shuri's desk, causing Shuri to break out into cold sweats. "And please bring that light-capturing ball with you as well."

As the door closed behind the Sect Leader, Shuri's body gave way and collapsed onto the ground. Her eyes stared blankly into the ceiling.

"Fuck..."

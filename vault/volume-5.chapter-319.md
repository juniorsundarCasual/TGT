Shuri controlled her shaking breath and shivering legs before hurriedly opening the door for the Sect Leader. The man who she'd been trying to avoid all this time had just graced her room. At this point, Shuri just didn't care. This was the worst case scenario- NO, there was a worse case than this which Shuri didn't even want to fathom lest that action of imagining the case itself resulted in the world conspiring against her.

"Umm, Sect Leader Larks. Greetings!" Shuri said with a low bow. Her body moved stiffly, as fear, uncertainty and doubt started to overpower her mucles.

"No need for all those formalities," Sect Leader Larks responded with a wave of his hands. "Everyone was worried when you didn't show up for dinner. Grace was just about to storm in here and throw a fit, but I managed to stop her," he added with a chuckle. He probably wanted her to chime in too, but her mind was checked out to follow blatant social cues, so what ensued was a one-sided chuckle that went on for too long turning awkward in the process. 

The Sect Leader coughed to try (and fail to) disperse the awkwardness and then raised up a covered plate in his hands to reveal her luck and dinner. He then scooted past Shuri - who had been frozen stiff, blocking the doorway - and placed it on her table. He removed the cover, to reveal a filled plate with a colourful assortment of food. "I also heard that you skipped lunch?"

"I was a bit busy," Shuri answered flatly. "My apologies."

"Don't apologise to me, it is your health that you are ruining with your carelessness," Sect Leader Larks chided. "If anyone deserves an apology it is you alone. Well I should also apologise"

He reached forward, causing Shuri to flinch. "Woah! Relax. I'm not going to hurt you."

"Okay," Shuri responded curtly before retreating a few steps. Her gaze was affixed on the man in her room, who shuffled backwards uncomfortably before finding a chair and taking a seat. He then gestured for Shuri to sit opposite him on her bed. After the two were seated, he sent an expectant gaze her way hoping that a conversation would ensue. This time, though, Shuri wasn't going to fall for the classic trap. Similar to negotiations, the person who spoke first always loses.

"So," Sect Leader Larks said, cutting the silence short before it continued on for too long. His fingers drummed Shuri's work table with a stiff rhythm, accentuating the discomfort he was feeling. "I just realised that I never really got the opportunity to have a conversation with you. An opportunity presented itself today, so I decided, why not?"

"If that is what the Sect Leader wishes," Shuri affirmed while jumping up from her bed and offering a respectful bow.

"Its not like that..." he said hurriedly while frantically shaking his hands before releasing a tired sigh.

"It seems you have a rather rigid image of myself in your mind," he continued while tilting his head backwards. "Do not be so quick to draw conclusions, Shuri. I'm a pretty chill dude!"

Shuri's gaze narrowed, 'What does his body temperature have to do with anything?'

She decided to not question the man's ramblings and nodded with a smile. Upon receiving a smile back in response, Shuri congratulated herself for deciphering the new social instance correctly and filed it into her mind for a later date.

The man then clapped his hands and exclaimed, "Umm, why don't we start with an introduction? I'll start."

"My name is Guy Larks - as you probably know. I "

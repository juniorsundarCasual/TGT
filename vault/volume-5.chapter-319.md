Shuri controlled her shaking breath and shivering legs before hurriedly opening the door for the Sect Leader. The man who she'd been trying to avoid all this time had just graced her room. At this point, Shuri just didn't care. This was the worst case scenario- NO, there was a worse case than this which Shuri didn't even want to fathom lest that action of imagining the case itself resulted in the world conspiring against her.

"Umm, Sect Leader Larks. Greetings!" Shuri said with a low bow.

"No need for all those formalities," Sect Leader Larks responded with a wave of his hands. "Everyone was worried when you didn't show up for dinner. Grace was just about to storm in here and throw a fit, but I managed to stop her," he added with a wry smile.

He raised up a covered plate in his hands, scooted past Shuri - who had been strategically blocking the doorway - and placed it on her table. He removed the cover, to reveal a filled plate with a colourful assortment of food. "I also heard that you skipped lunch?"

"I was a bit busy," Shuri answered. "My apologies."

"Don't apologise to me, it is your health that you are ruining with your carelessness," Sect Leader Larks chided. "If anyone deserves an apology it is you alone."

He reached forward, causing Shuri to flinch. "Woah! Relax. I'm not going to hurt you."

"Okay," Shuri responded curtly before retreating a few steps. Her gaze was affixed on the man in her room, who shuffled backwards uncomfortably.

"So," Sect Leader Larks said, cutting through the awkward silence. His fingers drummed Shuri's work table with a stiff rhythym, accentuating the discomfort he was feeling. "I just realised that I never really got the opportunity to have a conversation with you. Since we're here, might as well, right?"

"If that is what the Sect Leader wishes," Shuri affirmed with a respectful bow.

"Its not like that..." he said hurriedly while frantically shaking his hands.

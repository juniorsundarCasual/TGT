Guy nearly chewed through his fingers with anxiety as he waited for the sun to hit its peak and make its way to the other side of the horizon. Sect registration would end around noon, by which time the stragglers and weaklings would be filtered out, and the newly officiated sects would all swarm towards the Recruitment Event's location and pen down their names at their preferred stalls.

At that time, the unofficial battle royale would commence in which the claims for each stall would be challenged where the winner would gain its ownership. Once the last registered sect made it to the location, the first fight sprung off - it was for the very first stall by the entrance.

One thing Guy learned about these battle royale fights for stall right was that a Sect Leader or Elder could not take part it in - only a sect member could represent their sect. After all, this would act as an opportunity to show off a sect's strength for the public - a sect's Leader had to be strong. Speaking of public, a crowd consisting of random passers-by and parties interested in joining a Sect was starting to form and observe the fights.

Twenty youths strode up the steps to the combat arena.

"They barely have enough space to move about!" Guy exclaimed.

"A lot of spells will be flying about. Many will get caught off-guard and suffer injuries," Jean added with a tinge of worry. After having lunch, Jean decided to follow Guy and Markus and observe the proceedings. As part of the True World Sect, she didn't want to be left out. She couldn't fight, and so her Senior Brother would have to carry the True World Sect's banner. Therefore, it was only right for her to support him in every way possible.

Once the youths assumed their position at the ready, the fight began with the slap of a gong. Everyone burst into action. Spells were hurled, weapons collided, flesh struck flesh, nothing made sense as an observer unless your mana senses were running with pinpoint accuracy. Within ten seconds, the fight was over, and a single girl with a broken right arm and bruised face remained standing with unstable footing.

"Stall Number 1 goes to the Crimson Heart Sect," a detached voice declared. The unconscious and ragged bodies still remaining on the platform were dragged away by their respective sects and the platform was cleared for the next group to enter. It was mechanically efficient, and a bit difficult to watch.

The second fight was much faster - it barely lasted eight seconds. Once again, the bodies were removed, the field was cleared and the fights went on. The first ten or so had a similar turn out, with a rather overcrowded combat arena and short bouts that rarely lasted past the fifteen-second mark. After that, things started to slow down and the fights started to extend for at most a minute and a half.

While Guy struggled to keep his eyes peeled through the whole ordeal (he did not enjoy watching kids beating each other up so brutally even if their advanced cultivation gifted them with superior endurance), and Jean fretted over the plethora of injuries sustained by the combatants as they exited the arena, Markus retrieved his Grimoire and furiously jotted down his impressions on the bouts as they happened. As usual, he placed himself in the position of the combatants and theorised how he would approach the fights with his own style.

Noticing his Disciple's fervour, Guy placed a hand on his shoulder and said, "Don't stress yourself too much over the coming match. Even if we don't get this one, there is always the next one."

Although Guy trusted his Disciple, he did not want the kid to exhaust and expend himself, and end up with a serious injury. "If things grow beyond your control, and you chance of victory becomes less than certain, just give up and prepare yourself for the next one. Since we do not have many members in our Sect just yet, we need to play it smart."

Markus nodded pensievely without moving his gaze away from the arena.

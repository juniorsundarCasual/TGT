He could not see the man on the other side, there was only a void, but the voice carried through the crack unhindered. The voice that spoke through the tear in space was familiar, in that it mimicked Guy's own. However, there was a difference in tone and diction. There was a self-assured piousness and confidence in the voice that was lacking in Guy's.

"You did this!" Guy accused immediately. His voice was tinged with anger and betrayal.

"Technically, we share the same body. So for all intents and purpose, you are equally liable for what transpired."

"No!" Guy denied vehemently. "Y-You took over my body a-and you did... all that!"

"Took over your body? Need I remind you that the body you're inhabiting does not belong to you in the first place."

That retort caused Guy to pause in his decision to argue back. He caught on to his current hysterical state, and tried to calm himself once again. There was no use arguing with someone so entrenched in fanaticism as the Other Guy. It was best to ask rational questions so that he could extract the most amount of information from him as possible.

"Why did you do it?" A plain question inquiring upon the man's purpose. If he could take over Guy's body like this, why didn't he do it earlier? Maybe when the bandits attacked the caravan, or maybe when that boy threatened Guy and the Sect.

"Because it was necessary," the Other Guy answered without hesitation.

"You decided that by yourself?" Guy challenged.

"It isn't my opinion, but a fact," the Other Guy reaffirmed. "What would you have done differently? Talk to them? And then what? Tell me, what use is diplomacy when dealing with animals?"

"It is not our right to take away the life of another-"

"What gives them the right, then? You read it yourself, that man alone blinded over two-hundred and forty-three children."

The Other Guy paused, and Guy could feel a genuine rage emanating from the man's voice and aura.

"TWO-HUNDRED AND FORTY-THREE!" The voice boomed through the crack, causing Guy to flinch involuntary. He then heard the man draw in a deep breath before continuing, "Interestingly, that number only consists of boys. What do you think he did with the girls? You can find the answer to that question in any of the brothels connected with the Beggars' Sect. Do you still think the man doesn't deserve what I gave him? Can you honestly tell me that NONE of the filth parading in human skin whose lives I liberated did not deserve it?"

"I don't know!" Guy blurted out. "Look, I can understand what you did to the leader, but can YOU honestly tell me that everyone else affiliated to this Sect deserves death?"

"Yes." Once again, no hesistation. "They made their choice when they decided to throw in their lot with this ilk. Children, I can understand - I can empathise. They have little to no agency in their lives, and their actions are heavily influenced by what they observe around them or what the world foists upon them. Adults, on the other hand, they have the agency to control their own lives."

"Do they? What if their life is set out for them from birth? As you said, a child lives their life like a sponge, what if all that sponge absorbs in the maliciousness the world has to offer? What if this is all that they know to be their truth? Do you still think that they cannot be redeemed?" Guy argued.

"There are some stains that cannot be purged. No matter how much redemption they seek, the damage they've done to others cannot be rewound," the Other Guy declared with complete certainty. "I am not going to argue over the morality of my actions, especially not with you, who still teeters on the fence even after the world has gently guided you towards a conclusion since you transmigrated."

"What do you mean?"

"This isn't Earth. I don't know what it will take to get that fact through your head?" The Other Guy growled exasperatedly. "It will chew you up and spit you out if you let it. There is always a place for diplomacy, but that does not mean you can just toss aside the power of physical force. Take a moment to evaluate my actions more critically. Do not think my actions to be that of a narrow-minded fanatic. In many ways, our goals align. Our values align. It is just our choice of action that differs. I don't know why I'm even trying to assuage you... Well, this ends our conversation. Till next time (and I promise that there WILL be a next time)!"

As the Other Guy finished his sentence, Guy could hear his voice receding into the distance. Now, Guy was left all alone, by himself, in the RoK in front of the mysterious tear.

Every mind has a threshold where it is bombarded with so much information that it breaks. However, there is a bandwidth before that point where the damage is fairly perfunctory in the form of cracks. Since it isn't an irrecoverable outcome, the mind, just like every biological system, tries to fix itself. Take the analogy of a human body, when there is a cut, the body tries to heal that injury by first clotting blood over the area to isolate it from contamination, and then slowly reforms the cut skin underneath the scab. This is a fairly basic regenerative operation, since the cut is only at the surface level and basic. On the other hand, if an entire appendage is sliced off, the process of healing becomes more impossible if care is not administered immediately.

There is, however, a bandwidth between these two extremes where the damage is sufficiently extensive, but still recoverable. For children and people with deformities in the bone, there is an operation that seeks to correct it by breaking the affected bone and holding the two ends in a frame that orients them the right way. The change is done incrementally, so that the bones "know" where to connect. Some use this procedure to aesthetically increase their heights; by incrementally increasing separation between the sliced bones, they are forced to form new bone cells to fill in the blanks. The mind is also known to do something like that at a psychological level.

Guy's mind had cracked under the sudden influx of shocking information. Regardless of how calmly he carried himself, he was floundering internally. The paint was spilt on the canvas without his control, but it was his body that ultimately spoiled the artwork. The blame would fall on him. He now had to live with this fact.

If this was in his past life, there were ways to deal with it. First off, he would admit himself to an Institute of Mental Health and seek treatment. Of course, if he had murdered someone, he would first need to turn himself into the authorities, which would lead him down a rabbit hole of litigation and convincing the government that he wasn't in full control of his body, which shouldn't have been too hard given the level the field of phychiatry and psychology had reached during his time. Even if that wasn't possible, he could always leverage the capacity of an expert criminal lawyer to plead insanity through any means necessary.

However, just like the Other Guy said, this world was different.

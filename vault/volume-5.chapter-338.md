"I didn't expect this from you, Guy," Grace said while shaking her head with a disappointed frown. Her hand moved with practised efficiency, as it dipped a towel into a pot of cold water, squeezed out the excess and gently placed it over Shuri's hot forehead. "You're telling me that this is an adverse reaction from some kind of cultivation deviation?"

"I said it's a possibility-"

"Oh, please!" Grace interjected. "'When you have eliminated all that which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.' Shuri isn't sick with any illness we know of. It isn't anything that I have seen before in my lifetime. All that remains is what I haven't seen, and that falls under the forsaken cultivation category. Guy, this is serious!"

"I'm not taking it lightly," Guy argued.

"Really? I don't believe you. The Guy I know wouldn't hand such a heavy reading list to a little girl in the first place," Grace responded.

"I didn't know she would binge them all within days of getting the list," Guy reasoned, but his resolve was weak, which Grace caught like an eagle plucking a bird mid-flight.

"If that is truly the case, then I have grossly overestimated your proficiency as an educator, Guy," she said with a disdainful expression. "I didn't think that you of all people would make such a mistake."

Guy looked away in embarrassment and guilt.

"It was Marie, wasn't it?" Grace asked with a growl. "She put you up to this, didn't she? Don't even try denying, this whole set-up has her stench all over it."

"She did 'suggest' that it would be beneficial for Shuri if she were to whet her mind with this knowledge," Guy admitted with a wry smile.

"And you just went along with it?" Grace challenged, to which Guy nodded reluctantly. She scoffed loudly and said, "And pray tell why you did something so idiotic?"

"The girl can see the future, damn it!" Guy retorted loudly. "Who am I to argue with the future?"

"You're the damn Sect Leader of the True World Sect!" Grace shot back. "So what if Marie can see the future. What does she know about teaching? What does she know about shepherding kids? Let me take a page out of your book and draw you a picture. What you basically did was hand the reins of a blind dog, to a dog with functioning eyes. Just because one can see ahead doesn't mean it knows were to go."

Grace looked up and released an exhausted sigh. "Do not become utilitarian, Guy. That is Marie's downfall. It has only become worse after she started cultivating the Heavenly Eye. Be who you were: a caring man and an insightful educator. The future is set in stone, Guy. Do not change yourself or slack off just because the future is inevitable."

She stood up and picked up the pot of water. "Fix this," she declared before leaving the room.

Guy watched Grace trudge away and let out a long, conflicted breath. He knew Grace was right. And the more he evaluated his behaviour, the more annoyed and disgusted he felt with himself. Although he knew that Marie meant well, he should have taken a more hands-on approach on this matter.

"There's no point crying over spilt milk or cracked eggs now, is there?" Guy mumbled with a sigh, and pulled out the chair by Shuri's work table

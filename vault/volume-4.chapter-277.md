"Why?" Shuri asked. She immediately followed up by saying, "Don't tell me that its because it is the right thing to do, or some stupid reason like that."

As she said those words, Shuri realised that she had actually spoken out her mind. She realised that the many filters she applied on every word she spoke had suddenly disappeared.

Markus chuckled mirthfully and said, "It IS the right thing to do."

He looked directly at her with a neutral expression and continued, "I'll be honest with you. There are a lot of inconsistencies in your stories."

Shuri agreed on that point. She hadn't been managing her backstory with the same level of stringency in the past day or so as she did in the past. She blamed this oversight on the intense emotional and semi-physical rollercoaster she had the privilege of riding. Nonetheless, having her mistake pointed out made her realise that she had severely underestimated the boy's emotional intelligence. Everyone lies. That was a fact. And this boy here had played the bumbling, innocent act to lure her into a false sense of security.

"But, I choose to ignore these inconsistencies because of a simple fact," Markus raised a finger and said, "It doesn't matter."

"You do have parents," Markus affirmed. "But you ran away from home. If this was just a rebellious act, you wouldn't carry yourself so decisively. Your behaviour and actions show no indication or hint of you reverting to your past life. You didn't care about the poor condition of this inn, or the shabby presentation of the food even though you clearly are from a family from the higher rungs of society."

"A child never runs away from home and cuts all ties like this unless there is something seriously wrong," Markus highlighted. "I bet you planned everything down to the detail - your escape, your new life, you entire future! But it all fell apart because of something out of your control."

Markus shrugged, "Shit happens! You can't control the world, no matter how hard you try. But you CAN control how to adapt to what the world throws at you. However, if even that becomes difficult, you can always rely on someone else."

Shuri held back her scoff. Why would she entrust herself to someone else's mercy willingly? It was akin to handing a sharpened knife to a turncoat and expecting them to not stab you in the back when the going gets tough.

"You're effectively stranded now," Markus reminded. "I can't, in good conscience, leave a fellow youth go through a painful experience all alone if I can help it. Therefore, I'd like to offer you a hand. Join my Sect - use it as an opportunity to regroup. You don't have to cultivate if you don't want to, there are many job opportunities open if you wish to earn money in the meantime."

"You're quite perceptive," Shuri commended instinctively. "I didn't..." expect the boy to narrate the entirety of her life so succinctly.

"I don't even know anything about your sect," Shuri responded, but it was imme

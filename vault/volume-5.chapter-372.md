"Missed again!" Kevan yelled, as the |Fireball| coming his way missed him by a complete arm's length. "But it was closer this time."

"You don't have to rub it in my face each time, you know?" Yohn groaned back with a tired sigh. "I hope you realise that aiming while blind is as hard as it sounds."

"I get that, but like-" Kevan paused to carefully measure his next words before saying, "can't you aim in the general direction of my voice?"

"What do you think I'm doing?" Yohn snapped back.

"But you aren't even looking my way," Kevan argued.

"What benefit would that do me? I'm using my ears to find you, aren't I?" Yohn scoffed.

"I've read studies that show that looking in the direction you are trying to shoot improves your aim," Kevan narrated from memory.

To that, Yohn let out a sarcastic chuckle and said, "If you haven't noticed-" he pried apart his closed eyelids to reveal his empty continued, "-but I don't have eyes to 'look' at something."

Kevan scratched his head wryly and admitted, "I'm just trying to help, you know?"

"I understand," Yohn responded. "But you have to tell me something I haven't already tried, Kevan."

"What about your mana senses?" Kevan shot back while snapping his finger.

"It doesn't extend far enough," Yohn answered disappointedly. "That was the first thing I tried after I broke through to the Middle stage. However, my mana sense barely extends past an extended arm's length. I can see everything within clearly, even more so that when I still had my eyes, but anything beyond that I'm as blind as a bat."

"Interesting fact," Kevan chimed in. "Bats aren't actually blind. Studies have shown that their visual acuity is far superior to a human's."

There was silence as Kevan finished his sentence. He looked towards Yohn, and he could see the unimpressed sarcasm oozing out of his friend. It was clear that the "interesting fact" was unwelcome.

"I'm just saying," Kevan defended himself. "People assume that just because bats use echolocation and hunt at night, that they are blind in nature. But that is not actually true."

"You make a good point," Yohn mumbled while scratching his chin in thought.

"Okay," Kevan said with a loud exhale. "You don't have to keep mocking me-"

"I'm not!" Yohn corrected. "Echolocation sounds interesting. It's basically what we're trying to do right now."

"But bats use the reflection of emitted ultrasound," Kevan corrected. "We're just using the environmental noise to position ourselves."

"So if I were to, hypothetically, emit ultrasound and then analyse the reflection, I should be able to see?"

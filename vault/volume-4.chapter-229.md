The Emperor's room was concentrated with the smell of various herbs and potions. A translucent veil was drawn that blocked the view of the Emperor himself who lay on his bed while frequently releasing pained groans. Following the aftermath of the fight with Yor, the Emperor was transported to his chambers by his personal staff while the whole debacle was silenced... as best as possible. It wasn't optimal for word to spread that the Ruler of the Solar Empire was suffering from a serious injury - any outward display of weakness would agitate the sharks circling the water. Any rumours that continued to float within Palace were promptly eliminated, by any means necessary.

Apart from the ailing Emperor, the only other entity within the room at this moment was the Royal Healer, who was struggling to come up with the right combination of words to explain his diagnosis to his patient.

"Unfortunately..." The Royal Healer held his tongue while trying his hardest to avert his gaze from the gruesome amalgamation of flesh.

"Unfortunately what?" The Emperor growled angrily, before yelping at the sudden outburst of pain originating from his crotch. There were no words that could describe the anguish he was suffering through. Not in his entire life had he ever felt so drained and tortured. The cherry on top was the utter humiliation. Why did the wretched miscreant target his nether regions of all places? All his subjects had seen him roll and grovel on the ground like a common beggar! The rage burst out for a short flash before the pain reared its head again.

"Well, the nature of the attack was a bit of a mystery for us. The green flames, though they behaved similar to a regular fire, the nature of the way they burned deviated a bit. The nature of the reaction was not combustion in the traditional sense. You see-"

"Just get to the DAMN POINT!" The Emperor bellowed.

"Manticore venom!" The Royal Healer blurted out.

"What?"

"The Royal Librarian investigated the scene and managed to recollect an entry in the records about Manticores and their signature venom attacks," the Royal Healer elaborated. "After cross-referencing and running a myriad of tests with the few residues from the attacks we were able to determine that the attacker's attacks closely matched those of a Manticore."

"What use is this information?" The Emperor groaned.

"Your Majesty must be acquainted with Manticore venom," the Royal Healer hinted. "A Manticore has tiers to their venomous attack. The regular neurotoxin they use to hunt is a fast acting paralytic which is fairly simple to counteract. This is at the lower end of their attack spectrum. What the attacker used on you as their core destabilised is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Truthfully, there have been little to no written records of such an attack since it is believed that a sacrifice of vitality is necessary to sustain it. The venom used in this attack was most potent. Imagine taking the strongest venom a Manticore can produce, distilling it to increase its concentration and then multiplying it by ten by running it through an Alchemical Potentiator. Essentially, this venom has altered your physique itself, Your Majesty. Even if healing potions are ingested, the parts lost cannot be regenerated since the venom has rendered them non-existent. It has literally deleted the parts out of your physique."

"You don't mean..."

The Royal Healer bit his lips, nearly drawing blood, before releasing a long sigh. "We can salvage the urinary tract and the anus, but unfortunately, the testicles and the penis are irredeemable."

The Emperor's eyes glazed over, as life was drained off them. His entire world shattered as the truth settled in.

At that moment, the newly promoted Head Eunuch entered the room in a low-bowed posture and inquired, "Your Majesty. Consort Nuri is waiting outside. She appears distraught and is urging us to disclose His Majesty's state."

The person in question, Consort Nuri, was the Emperor's currently favoured in the Inner Court.

"Tell her I'm fine," the Emperor waved away.

"This lowly one has conveyed that message already, yet Consort Nuri appears adamant..." the Head Eunuch responded while suppressing the sweat attempting to soak through his garb.

"Fuck! Just tell her to get lost. Do I look like I'm in any position to entertain those scheming shrews?!" The Emperor shouted, trying his utmost to cloak the groan from diminishing his gravitas.

The Head Eunuch bowed even lower and retreated through the door while facing forward.

"Who else knows?" The Emperor asked the Royal Healer with a morose whisper.

"Knows...?"

"About. My. Condition!" The Emperor gnarled.

"Umm... I have taken the initiative to enforce strict confidentiality. As it stands, only I am aware of your... condition, Your Majesty."

"Good... good," The Emperor mumbled. "What of my recovery, then?"

"Not to worry, Your Majesty, I have conveyed the treatment process to my subordinates in the Health Department," the Royal Healer assuaged.

"Good, then this makes things easier..."

"What-" The Royal Healer croaked as a sudden increase in pressure around his neck inhibited him from communicating and breathing.

"Y-Your-?"

With an audible crack, the Royal Healer was dead and with him died a shocking revelation: that the Emperor was now a eunuch.

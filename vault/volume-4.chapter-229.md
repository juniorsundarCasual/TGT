The Emperor's room was concentrated with the smell of various herbs and potions.

"Unfortunately..." The Royal Healer held his tongue while trying his hardest to avert his gaze from the gruesome amalgamation of flesh.

"Unfortunately what?" The Emperor growled.

"Your Majesty must be acquainted with Manticore venom," the Royal Healer hinted. "It is a venom most potent capable of affecting a target to their roots. The attack has altered your physique itself, your majesty. Even if healing potions are ingested, the parts lost cannot be regenerated since the venom has rendered them nonexistent. It has literally burned the parts out of your physique."

The Emperor released an ear-shattering bellow that echoed throughout the Capital. His quarters were decimated at his uncontrolled discharge of power. Following that, there was another minor purge of the Palace as every individual present who observed the Emperor's loss and subsequent mutilation was removed from existence.

The world could not know that the Emperor of the Solar Empire was a eunuch.

"You were supposed to be here an hour ago," Sect Leader Larks said with a stern tone. "I hate to be THAT guy," a snort escaped from Sect Leader Larks as he looked at Shuri with an expectant smile.

"*cough* As I was saying, what took you so long?" The Sect Leader reiterated.

"I went to meet Senior Sister Marie," Shuri admitted. There was no point in being ingenuous or obfuscate information here. Per Mage Larks' admission, most if not all of what occurred within the Sect was known or common knowledge.

The Sect Leader furrowed his brows and asked, "Did she ask you to do some more work for her?"

Shuri quickly waved her hand and explained, "Nothing like that. I just felt that it wasn't right to leave her employ without a proper goodbye."

"That's... admirable," the man mumbled while bobbing his head appreciatively. Then, he narrowed his gaze and probed, "Did she say anything? Did she give you anything?"

Shuri nodded and produced the cube from her jacket pocket.

"Wow! Okay! This one belonged to me before. Marie snatched it from me a few days back, saying that she knew someone who would appreciate it more than I. What you have there is a Rubik's Cube. A rather interesting toy, this one. A bit on the difficult side to make out of wood, especially if you're trying to keep it purely wooden. Took me quite a while to get it just right, though as it stands it isn't viable to mass produce this profitably," the Sect Leader narrated as he picked up the Rubik's Cube and started to spin its sides.

"She gave me this and said that it might inspire me to do something," Shuri added.

"Can't believe she's still doing this nonsense. Even after I warned her," the Sect Leader growled while continuing the task of shuffling the cube.

Then, he turned silent as he started to spin the cube in a similar pattern multiple times until eventually, the jumbled cube resolved itself with uniform colours on all side.

"There!" He celebrated while returning the cube to Shuri.

"She did say this would be the last interference," Shuri mumbled while spinning the cube around in her grasp. "How did you solve it?"

"There's a book about it in the Library, if you're interested," Mage Larks offered. "It's not that hard, especially for you. You just have to memorise a few combinations according to how the colours are arranged. That is the most basic method. There are quicker and more complicated strategies as well."

He then raised his index finger and added, "Did you know? There are approximately 43 quintillion unique possible arrangements of this cube?"

Shuri tilted her head and said, "Shouldn't there be more? Let me see... eight corner pieces... 12 edge pieces... No, definitely larger than 43 quintillion."

"Mathematically, sure. But the cube can only turn in certain ways. This limits some permutations," Mage Larks corrected. "Try again, but implement the limitations into your calculations."

As he said this, he pushed forward a blank parchment and a writing utensil. Shuri picked it up and started to pen down the numbers. She performed the mathematics for five whole minutes before she dropped the pencil in frustration. "This is impossible! I can't keep track of the numbers."

"Makes you wish you had a calculator, huh?" The Sect Leader commented.

"A calculator?" Shuri asked.

"Think of it like a device that can perform basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, maybe more," the man expounded.

"How does it do that?" Shuri followed up, voicing her doubt and interest.

The Sect Leader scratched his head in thought. "Give me a second," he then said before sitting down in a meditative pose.

After a few minutes, his eyes opened and his expression reverted with confidence. "There are many kinds of calculators. The most basic one I can describe for you is a mechanical calculator that uses gears. Any number, if written in digital form, holds a value from zero to nine, which translates to ten possible values. If we assign this to a gear, that means ten rotations. Ten rotations of the units place corresponds to one rotation in the tens place. Ten of tens is a hundred, and so on. So you can imagine how addition operations could be designed with this system?"

Shuri hummed along before raising a point, "But I can see a few problems here. It would be difficult to support large numbers with greater number of digits, as well as multiplication and division operations."

"Exactly, so let me try and describe another mechanical calculator which has this functionality," Sect Leader Larks highlighted before descending into an explanation of a magnificent machine that he called the arithmometer.

The explanation continued for hours, with the man using all the blackboards in his office to draw an elaborate picture of the device, answering Shuri's questions, and even showing examples. Sometimes, there were questions Sect Leader Larks couldn't answer immediately - he would often enter into meditation before returning with a suitable answer. Shuri theorised that he too probably had some sort of memorising power like she did, but one that was much slower or was maybe bogged down with so much information that retrieval took a lot of time.

"Well, that was definitely a heavy topic," the Sect Leader declared before leaning against his table and taking a sip of water from a cup. "I didn't plan to cover this today, not at all. But it wasn't an unproductive trip, was it?"

Seeing as Shuri agreed with his words, he continued, "If you are interested, we can pick up from here tomorrow and cover a few more mechanical solutions before shifting into the automatic solutions."

"What are automatic version of the calculator?" Shuri interjected.

"Hmm, it's about the nature by which the calculator is powered. The mechanical solutions, as you saw earlier, rely on movement of a crank. It takes mechanical input to run its operations. An automatic version uses another form of energy," the Sect Leader explained.

"What alternate form?" Shuri probed further.

"Let's leave that for the next class, shall we?"

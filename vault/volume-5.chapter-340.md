"You were supposed to be here an hour ago," Sect Leader Larks said with a stern tone. "I hate to be THAT guy," a snort escaped from Sect Leader Larks as he looked at Shuri with an expectant smile.

"*cough* As I was saying, what took you so long?" The Sect Leader reiterated.

"I went to meet Senior Sister Marie," Shuri admitted. There was no point in being ingenuous or obfuscate information here. Per Mage Larks' admission, most if not all of what occurred within the Sect was known or common knowledge.

The Sect Leader furrowed his brows and asked, "Did she ask you to do some more work for her?"

Shuri quickly waved her hand and explained, "Nothing like that. I just felt that it wasn't right to leave her employ without a proper goodbye."

"That's... admirable," the man mumbled while bobbing his head appreciatively. Then, he narrowed his gaze and probed, "Did she say anything? Did she give you anything?"

Shuri nodded and produced the cube from her jacket pocket.

"Wow! Okay! This one belonged to me before. Marie snatched it from me a few days back, saying that she knew someone who would appreciate it more than I. What you have there is a Rubik's Cube. A rather interesting toy, this one. A bit on the difficult side to make out of wood, especially if you're trying to keep it purely wooden. Took me quite a while to get it just right, though as it stands it isn't viable to mass produce this profitably," the Sect Leader narrated as he picked up the Rubik's Cube and started to spin its sides.

"She gave me this and said that it might inspire me to do something," Shuri added.

"Can't believe she's still doing this nonsense. Even after I warned her," the Sect Leader growled while continuing the task of shuffling the cube.

Then, he turned silent as he started to spin the cube in a similar pattern multiple times until eventually, the jumbled cube resolved itself with uniform colours on all side.

"There!" He celebrated while returning the cube to Shuri.

"She did say this would be the last interference," Shuri mumbled while spinning the cube around in her grasp. "How did you solve it?"

"There's a book about it in the Library, if you're interested," Mage Larks offered. "It's not that hard, especially for you. You just have to memorise a few combinations according to how the colours are arranged. That is the most basic method. There are quicker and more complicated strategies as well."

He then raised his index finger and added, "Did you know? There are approximately 43 quintillion unique possible arrangements of this cube?"

Shuri tilted her head and said, "Shouldn't there be more? Let me see... eight corner pieces... 12 edge pieces... No, definitely larger than 43 quintillion."

"Mathematically, sure. But the cube can only turn in certain ways. This limits some permutations," Mage Larks corrected. "Try again, but implement the limitations into your calculations."

As he said this, he pushed forward a blank parchment and a writing utensil. Shuri picked it up and started to pen down the numbers. She performed the mathematics for five whole minutes before the long number: 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 took shape on the page.

"There's some interesting maths in even the most mundane things around us," Mage Larks continued. "Take the chess board, for example. If I was to place a single grain"

What is a relapse? It is a term often attributed to an addiction. When, after abstaining from said addiction, a person slips up and reverts to old, destructive habits, it is called a relapse.

Shuri had relapsed. But the problem was, she didn't show that she was addicted in the first place. And what was she even addicted to?

It all came as a blur, to be frank. A sudden burst of ecstacy followed by a flash of images that even her eidetic memory skimmed over. And the next thing she knew, she had just acquired an entire company for the Verum Trading Company. The moment she realised what she had just done, Shuri had the sudden urge to just take a knife and end everything right then and there. Once again she had been betrayed, not by another person but by herself. 

At this point Shuri should have become used to it, seeing as how this was the new trend her life had taken ever since joining this forsaken Sect. While her life in the Palace was risky and treacherous, at least there were small victories that she could enjoy at times. Here though, it was just defeat after defeat, and it was taking a toll on her sanity. So much so that when offered a glimpse into a familiar life, Shuri went overboard. This was what happened with the whole Lowe's acquisition. Returning to familiarity after a painful journey into the unknown had caused her to over-compensate.

'And then there's this irksome feeling of being played like a fiddle that's gnawing away at me...'

It was especially so whenever Shuri interacted with Marie. Each conversation, action and decision felt like a convoluted game of chess in four dimensions.

'Why do I feel like she set me up for this too?'

In a sense, it felt like she was being groomed in a particular direction. Like a canine being groomed into a fearsome attack dog.

Shuri shook her head to clear her mind of distracting thoughts. The milk was already spilled, there was no point crying over it now. She might as well topple the other jugs while she was at it.

Returning to her desk, she directed her gaze towards the inert mana core affixed atop a custom stand of her design. Around the stand, were a series of tool and resources that were required for the upcoming process of programming the mana core. It was a delicate process with a large margin of error - something she couldn't afford to make at this moment. Although the set-up to farm the wisps and slimes was underway, it was yet to reach a state where a steady supply of mana cores could be expected from it. So, for the time being, this was the only mana core available.

Programming an inert mana core borrows its technique from Enchanting, in that an inscribing tool is necessary. The ink is a special blend of alchemical ingredients of the Clan's design, which Shuri had produced a phial full of.

Shuri emptied her lungs and pulled in a fresh breath of air. She then touched the mana gem embedded into the side of the stand and pulsed her mana through it. As she did so, the metallic stand started to glow with an ethereal purple colour which moved up towards the inert core. The colourless core filled up with the purple shade and grew brighter. Then, the light from the core exploded outwards, and expanded to form a holographic projection of the inert core centred at the now dull sphere.

A tense breath escaped Shuri's lips. The fact that the projection had succeeded proved that the stand and the enchantment on it had been done correctly. In order to conceal her affiliation with the Yoruz Clan, she had to commission the smithing and enchantment through various channels. While it was possible to do both using The Burning Forge, she could not afford to leave a trail for the Empire's agents to track. So, she had the smithing done in parts by two different people, with an extremely in-depth description of how the mana channels needed to be laid out so that there wouldn't be any issues when the parts came together. The inscription for the mana gem was done in-house, by her. It wasn't a hard one to etch into the mana gem, since technically this was the first thing any aspiring Automage (what the Yoruz Clan called the cultivators following the path of golemancy and magical-automation) had to achieve - the Programming Stand was the first step.

After steeling her resolve, Shuri raised the inscribing tool and brought it towards the projected hologram. The tool started to glow as her mana coursed through it. The moment the glowing tool neared the projection a purple ethereal mark spawned in the empty space. Shuri controlled her movements, especially the sudden shakiness assaulting her arm, and moved the tool along according to the very first design from her memory. The process was slow, and required steady movements. It was a bit more forgiving compared to Enchantment since the space she was working with was larger (compare a mana gem to an inert core). However, with the increased space came a much more expansive and intricate design. There was little room for error, and no time to pause. Luckily, Shuri was equipped with the gift of a perfect memory, what she envisioned was quickly formed in the empty ethereal projection.

To an extent, programming a mana core was very similar to inscribing on a mana gem. In fact, modern enchanting in Gaea was actually derived from mana core programming principles after multiple steps to condense the intricacy of the process. A mana core can hold a lot more inscriptions inside it compared to a mana gem, thus making it more multifunctional and able to perform more complex tasks. The more advanced the inert core is, the more inscriptions it can handle, thus making it able to accommodate more intricate tasks. For reference, a Core Formation realm core is so large that you would need up to five mages working on it simultaneously. The one in Shuri's work desk was only a Mana Condensation realm one, and it had the capacity to handle the most basic of tasks. And of all the available basic options, Shuri was attempting the most basic one.

Seconds ticked, turning to minutes that transitioned into hours. The sun, which was at its zenith when she started, had set and only then did Shuri finally release a slow and steady breath of satisfaction. She stopped channeling mana into the inscription tool and moved her hand over the mana gem at the side of the stand. Triggering the gem caused the purple light originating from the gem to dissipate. Once it reached the mana core, the projection flickered before rapidly compressing on top of the core itself. The dull core regained a purple sheen that oscillated in brightness. As this happened, a sizzling sound started to come out of the core.

Shuri subconsciously held her breath. This was the make-or-break stage of the entire process. If the core accepted the design, the sizzling would fizzle and the core would gain a permanent ethereal sheen. If it failed, the core would shatter.

"Success!" Shuri exclaimed as the orb settled with a faint, misty-white glow. The programming had succeeded. Shuri picked up the warm ball - with her mana sense, she could see it sucking in the surrounding mana with a steady stream. The programmed core, much like an inscribed mana gem, could function by itself as long as it had mana in it. The mana is replenished at a standard rate dependent on the core's stage. A successful program is one that ensures that the mana core's capacity does not dip below 90% at time of operation. However, this is only achievable if the core is set to do the most trivial of tasks. Realistically, a program has to teeter the line where mana consumption breaks even with the replenishment rate, in favour of the replenishment process. The Yoruz Clan's manuals did not explore this concept, instead preferring to provide the most optimal inscriptions directly (as they have already been tested thoroughly by the clan over the years).

Shuri looked towards the single source of light in her room, and held the ball between her sight and the source of light. She then channelled her mana through one of the core's two outer mana pathways. The ball grew brighter by a smidgen, but as it did so, the light on the wall grew dimmer until it turned off compeletely.

Revealing an excited smile - one which she allowed herself to revel in - Shuri channelled her mana through the other pathway, and a wisp of light escaped the ball (causing it to dim back to its original luminosity). The wisp jetted out with haste and settled back on the wall, causing it to grow brighter once again.

"YES!" Shuri exclaimed in delight. Her blood pumped vigorously, in agreement with her cheer. An exhilarating sense of achievement coursed through her nerves, causing her muscles to tense and release rapidly. 

"Oh~ Yeaaah!" An awkwardly long moan escaped her mouth. At that moment, she felt it! Her mana, it was moving around her body erratically. What was happening!

At once, the circulating mana rushed towards her core, and a faint tremor resonated throughout her body.

"This-"

Shuri held her mouth as another moan threatened an escape. At that moment, a series of knocks resounded from her door.

"Shuri? Are you inside? It's well past dinnertime and I didn't see you in the mess hall," a baritone masculine voice spoke.

Shuri's eyes widened in shock as her mind quickly connected the sound to the source.

"~I'm coming~" Shuri responded instinctively, though her momentary lapse due to shock had caused her voice to modulate atop the moan which she had forcefully held back.

If looks could drill holes, then Shuri was certain that there would be an incredibly narrow one cutting through her head given the sheer intensity with which Marie looked at her. The gaze did not hold any negativity - at least none that Shuri's highly attuned social sense could read. It was purely filled with intrigue and amusement.

Was it mockery? No, the amusement was not directed in Shuri's direction, it felt more like how a failed comic would laugh at their own joke - it was self-directed. Shuri was lost. The situation had spiraled beyond her control. She realised that ever since she left the safety of the Palace (there, she said it!) things hadn't been going her way. The more she tried to do sometime, the further she moved from achieving her girl. The harder she attempted to hide herself and avoid the attention of others, the more the world kept pushing her into the light.

"You never expected that you'd end up here, did you?" Marie broke through Shuri's rambling thoughts with a question that read her mind. The two, Marie and Shuri, were currently in the recreation room. After that disaster of an assembly where Shuri was caught with her trousers down (metaphorically), Marie dragged her along for a one-on-one meeting to discuss future assistantship expectations (a responsibility which was unceremoniously foisted upon Shuri).

"I'm not sure-"

"You don't have to keep playing a role," Marie interrupted. "Just be yourself."

Shuri bit back a few insults, which sporting a good-natured yet confused expression. Had she become so easy to read and manipulate that even two country bums could unravel her like a poorly tethered knot? 

"That's a hard ask, I know," Marie admitted. "You're in an unfamiliar place, amongst unfamiliar people. It is natural to be cautious and leery, especially given the condition during your recruitment."

Marie shook her head with silent rage, "I empathise with and am extremely sorry about what you were forced to live through. During my time working with various caravans in the past, I too had the displeasure of witnessing and experiencing abuse and assault."

Shuri's face twitched with discomfort. It was an unpleasant memory to say the least. The feeling of powerlessness, humiliation and her body's complete surrender to death still disturbed her sleep.

"So I cannot be so brazen and ask you to trust us readily," Marie admitted. "But I can tell you that being closed off and unreasonably cautious of everything can be far more detrimental to your recovery."

"Thank you for the advice, Senior," Shuri immediately responded. She would rather this conversation end right here. The longer Marie talked, the more Shuri felt a sense of danger sparking within her gut.

"No you aren't," Marie shot back immediately with a mirthful snort.

"Excuse me?"

"You aren't thankful," Marie clarified. And just as Shuri was about to explain herself, Marie raised her hand and continued, "You want this conversation to end. You want to disappear from sight and from mind. You want nothing more that to blend into the background and live amongst the average."

For the first time, Shuri outwardly displayed her panicking state.

"But you can't," Marie denied with a shrug. "Because you aren't average at all. You are gifted. What takes others years to achieve can be achieved in a matter of months by you. Things that take people hours to comprehend can be absorbed in a fraction of that time by you. You have so much potential, which you have forcefully to suppress through a self-imposed exile."

"W-Who are-"

"So here's what we'll do. I know that you don't really want to be my research assistant. And I'm willing to release you from this duty. However, there is a condition to your release," Marie paused while raising her index finger. "You must defeat me."

"Defeat you? In what?" Shuri shot back. Whatever game Marie was playing, Shuri was prepared to indulge it if it meant that she could run away from this witch!

To answer Shuri's query, Marie simply shrugged and leaned deeper into her chair.

"But you're a mage in the Foundation Establishment realm, while I'm just a mere mortal!" Shuri argued at the unfairness of the proposition.

Once again, Marie shrugged and revealed a sly smirk.

"You never intended to release me, did you?" Shuri asked through gritted teeth.

"No, I am sincere in my offer. All you need to do is defeat me," Marie reiterated. "I will even give you an infinite number of tries. But the duration is limited. You have a week. If you cannot defeat me within a week, you will be my research assistant until I say otherwise."

Noting that Marie wasn't indicating any signs of duplicity, Shuri shot up from her seat and moved to exit the recreation room.

"Where are you going?" A hand caught Shuri's arm with a vice grip and pulled her back into the seat.

"Umm... Figuring out a way to defeat you, I guess?" Shuri confessed, as she worked through the whiplash from the pull.

"You forget quickly for someone with an eidetic memory," Marie said with a chuckled. "You're still my research assistant. I need your assistance in data analysis."

As she said this, Marie picked up a large stack of papers tied up into a neat bundle and plopped it on the desk before Shuri. While her eyes tracked the massive stack, another one was retrieved from below the table and placed unceremoniously in front of Marie. Just as Shuri was about to ask what the data analysis entailed, a third stack materialised.

"How many more are there?" Shuri blurted out exasperatedly.

"Don't worry, it"

"Actually, it isn't that far off. The standard strategies work," the Sect Leader followed up with a shrug.

"For example-"

Two numbers: 1011 and 1001 appeared one on top of the other.

"If we are to add 11 and 9 in decimal digits, its summing 1 and 9 in the unit's place with a 1 carrying over to the tens place, which gets added to a one. So, 20. In binary, you add the ones in the 2^0, the 1 and 0 in 2^1 and the ones in 2^3, so-"

The addition resolved to get: 2012.

"But since we can't have number greater than one, we need to start carrying over. A 2 in 2^0 means that you can basically add a 1 to the 2^1, so-"

2020

"A 2 in the 2^2 is basically a 1 in the 2^2, so-"

2100

"A 2 in the 2^3 is 1 in the 2^4, so we can add another binary place/"

10100

"Now if you read this binary number, it should also give you 20."

"This just feels longer," Shuri mumbled.

"Maybe for you, sure," the Sect Leader responded. "But if you think about automatic systems, if a decimal place exceeds 1, then it is the same as flipping up a switch in the subsequent decimal place. You don't have to worry about excessive carrying over. All operations are just ones and zeroes, in the end."

"I guess that makes sense," Shuri admitted with a faintly sceptical tone.

"Let us check out the subtraction and the rest," the Sect Leader encouraged.

For Shuri, wrapping her head around this new method of digitally representing numbers was tougher. To that, the Sect Leader said, "There are many reasons it's difficult for you compared to the usual method. For one, you started learning in and were taught primarily in another method. This has become ingrained into so deeply that it's hard to regularise yourself with another. On top of that, this method isn't tractable for common mathematics that you and I use. It's meant for something else altogether."

"That's the thing, I can't see how this can be applied," Shuri said with a defeated sigh. "I feel like I'm missing something important."

"It will make sense once we start logic gates. With that in place, all this knowledge will come together into a neat bundle," the Sect Leader declared.

Shuri's enthusiasm rose once again as she anticipated the arrival of the crucial puzzle piece that would

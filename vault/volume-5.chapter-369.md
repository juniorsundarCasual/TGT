The Rebuttal round started with heavier applause, with palpable excitement radiating from the crowd. There were even some enthusiastic whooping as the debaters ascended the stage. The celebration was not unlike the time when two combatants with years of rivalry squared off against each other for a main-event match. Guy let out a satisfied smile as he observed the reactions from the crowd. He wasn't surprised, though, as he expected things to turn out like this from the start.

A debate is only as interesting as how invested the participants are in the topic they are supporting. People need to care about what they are arguing in favour of. If that emotion is evident, it then permeates into the crowd and makes them invested in the debate as well. Each of the seven debaters on stage are committed to a stance. They believe it from the bottom of their hearts, and are willing to fight in its favour (as evidenced by the fist fight they got into). Guy also took a few creative liberties with the debate format which he carried over from his past life. The standard format wasn't so sensational, opting for a more reserved and methodical process. For instance, during cross-examination, there isn't usually a dialogue between the examiner and examinee - the question and answer is fairly detached. But Guy figured that having some confrontation during the cross-examination period would sensationalise it a bit more, thus making it a bit more engaging for the audience. This was especially important in the Constructive segments since they are fairly less confrontational in nature - its about building up the argument.

The Rebuttal segment is all about defence. Each team would try to break apart the opposing argument while propping up their own. Guy looked to his left and gestured for Norris to step forward.

"The first debater stepping up is the team defending Definition 2, Norris."

Norris approached the podium with uncertain steps. Her gaze was lowered, and the piece of paper in her hand was nearly crumpled into a ball with stress. She grabbed the podium with both her hands, let out a long breath while closing her eyes, and started speaking.

"While we acknowledge the affirmative's drive for standardization, we contend that Definition 1's tunnel vision and rigidity conflicts with the nature of magic itself in the process. Indeed, standardization is valuable, but it must be achieved without sacrificing the core essence and versatility of magic. Definition 1 essentially places an asterisk against the very definition it proposes, suggesting that as long as all the dominoes fall into place – a specific spell is cast, a controlled scenario is established – only then can we truly measure mana. Magic is irregular, and mana is defined by the True World Sect to be the 'cheat code' that averts the natural laws. If we try to curtail magic in all its forms through the same lens of the natural phenomena, we will be sacrificing the primary nature of magic itself. Sure, it is necessary to regular a procedure so that it is repeatable and can provide comparable results no matter who performs it, but Definition 1 is far too strict in its limitations to be viable universally."

Norris' voice wasn't so loud as the others before her, as she was naturally a timid individual. However, the conviction in her words was far greater than all those before her, which roused the crowd that had returned fresh after the break and brought them right back into the heated debate.

Guy returned to the podium and urged the girl, who had reverted into a timid hunch, back to her team.

"An amazing first rebuttal by Norris, let us have a round of applause!" Guy initiated with some enthusiastic clapping. He wanted to encourage the girl to be confident in herself. Public speaking is tough for everyone. But having an especially bad experience can dissuade them from ever trying again. Guy wanted Norris' first attempt to be memorable and positive.

"Our next speaker is from the team defending Definition 1, Lacey."

Lacey approached the stadium amidst light applause. It was evident that she, just like her sister, was more famous amongst the Sect members. Especially because she was one of the creators of a game played by everyone on campus. Guy was sure that there would be some bias in play caused by the girls' fame when it finally came time for the audience to vote for the victor of the debate. 'We'll address that if need be.'

Guy didn't want to doctor the results... but he also didn't want the outcome from this pilot program to set a precedent for the other debates down the line. To him, some unethical manipulation against bias, and in favour of fairness was forgivable.

"In response to the negative, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about reductionism but about establishing a common language for the measurement of mana. By measuring energy through a specific transformation, we provide a consistent yardstick for comparisons. This is not evident in Definition 2. While we agree that magic and mana are fluid and variable, it is antithetical to hinge a concept that needs to be used by a myriad of people across different backgrounds and abilities on this variability as it makes it hard for everyone to have the same 'language' when communicating knowledge amongst themselves. We believe that the definition of a unit of mana is important for all future magical research as all analysis will be built upon it. And this research can be in a myriad of fields within magic, natural sciences and social sciences. Therefore, it is important to have an invariable structure so that whatever research that is built upon it doesn't collapse in the future."

Guy walked up on stage and

Affirmative Team:

2AR (Second Affirmative Rebuttal):
While we acknowledge the negative's appreciation for magic's artistic expression, we emphasize the importance of precision and coherence. Definition 1 doesn't discount creativity; it enhances our understanding by providing a quantifiable measure. The balance between standardization and diversity is achieved through Definition 1's framework, which is both comprehensive and adaptable.

Negative Team:

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
While we appreciate the affirmative's intent, it's vital to remember that a comprehensive understanding of mana shouldn't come at the cost of limiting magic's potential. By embracing Definition 2, which characterizes mana through the energy required for water creation via the |Water Spout| spell under standard temperature and pressure conditions, we honor both the artistry and adaptability of magic, ensuring our definition resonates with the diverse range of practitioners.

Summary Speeches:

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In our final plea, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about suppression but about providing a standardized measure that accommodates magic's universal principles. Our approach bridges the gap between precision and creativity, fostering a common ground for discussions. By quantifying mana through a specific transformation, we capture its essence while maintaining coherence and comparability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
In our closing, we reiterate that magic's essence lies in its multifaceted nature. Definition 2, which ties mana to water creation through the |Water Spout| spell, embraces magic's adaptability and creativity. By aligning mana with the act of creation, we honor the heart of magic and ensure our definition encompasses the full spectrum of magical abilities.

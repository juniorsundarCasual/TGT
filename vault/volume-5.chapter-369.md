Affirmative Team:

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In response to the negative, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about reductionism but about establishing a common language for the measurement of mana. By measuring energy through a specific transformation, we provide a consistent yardstick for comparisons. Magic's diversity isn't negated; it's embraced through a standardized approach that transcends individual practices.

2AR (Second Affirmative Rebuttal):
While we acknowledge the negative's appreciation for magic's artistic expression, we emphasize the importance of precision and coherence. Definition 1 doesn't discount creativity; it enhances our understanding by providing a quantifiable measure. The balance between standardization and diversity is achieved through Definition 1's framework, which is both comprehensive and adaptable.

Negative Team:

1NR (First Negative Rebuttal):
In response to the affirmative, we acknowledge the aspiration for standardization, but Definition 1's tunnel vision disregards the dynamic nature of magic. Magic isn't just about science; it's an art, a creation, and an expression. By advocating for Definition 1, the affirmative risks overshadowing the essence of magic itself, which thrives through creativity and adaptability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
While we appreciate the affirmative's intent, it's vital to remember that a comprehensive understanding of mana shouldn't come at the cost of limiting magic's potential. By embracing Definition 2, which characterizes mana through the energy required for water creation via the |Water Spout| spell under standard temperature and pressure conditions, we honor both the artistry and adaptability of magic, ensuring our definition resonates with the diverse range of practitioners.

Summary Speeches:

1AR (First Affirmative Rebuttal):
In our final plea, we assert that Definition 1 isn't about suppression but about providing a standardized measure that accommodates magic's universal principles. Our approach bridges the gap between precision and creativity, fostering a common ground for discussions. By quantifying mana through a specific transformation, we capture its essence while maintaining coherence and comparability.

2NR (Second Negative Rebuttal):
In our closing, we reiterate that magic's essence lies in its multifaceted nature. Definition 2, which ties mana to water creation through the |Water Spout| spell, embraces magic's adaptability and creativity. By aligning mana with the act of creation, we honor the heart of magic and ensure our definition encompasses the full spectrum of magical abilities.

"So let me get this straight, you want for your Disciple to gain access to the Hidden Celestial Sect's historic archives and records of the states of the known and observable celestial bodies? Why, exactly?" Jace inquired while sipping from his cup of tea.

"It's for her cultivation," Krish answered,

Jace lowered his cup and shot an exasperated gaze towards Krish, who deciphered the gaze's implications and elaborated, "She needs that information to achieve a breakthrough. She believes it is the piece that will tip her over to advance into Foundation Establishment realm."

Jace hummed contemplatively before raising a finger, "You said 'she needs' and 'she believes'. What's the deal with that? Isn't the cultivation pathway for The Heavenly Eye kind of fixed in the early stages?"

"Marie here is trying something different," Krish responded.

"And you're okay with that?" Jace's voice oozed with incredulity and disbelief. "You really have changed," he added with a low murmur.

"So, what do you say?" Krish reiterated.

"Fine, fine. You know the drill," Jace said with a wave of his hands.

"Wait!" Marie interjected sternly. "I have a few questions regarding the information you will be providing me access to."

With raised brows, Jace trained his complete attention towards Marie. "Excuse me?"

"Allegedly," she shot a side-eye towards her Master before returning Jace's gaze, "I was told that I would be able to find the information that I need here. I trust my Master. I trust that he has my best interests at heart. If my Master were to tell me something, I will believe it because I know where he's coming from. I cannot say the same for you, or for the Hidden Celestial Sect."

Jace released a hum that echoed within the room with an uneasy reverb. "I hope you realise that you are the one who is in need of this information."

"I am, which is why I want to first make sure that it is the information I am looking for," Marie reasoned. "They say that beggars can't be choosers, but what use is foisting a closet upon a beggar who owns only a single set of clothes and lacks a stable place to live? I have no use for information if it isn't relevant to my needs. Don't get me wrong though, I am thankful that you are offering me the opportunity to peruse your Sect's records."

From the corner of his eyes Jace caught Krish holding back a smirk with great difficulty. "Looks like you're enjoying the show. Did you put her up to this?"

"No," Krish said amidst a gleeful snort. Jace sighed at his friend's uncharacteristic mischevious demeanour and scratched his forehead in vexation.

Seeing this, Krish coughed and took over. "The Hidden Celestial Sect follow a special kind of cultivation method that relies on the precise state of the celestial bodies for specific effects."

"How so?" Marie asked back.

"Now, that's confidential information!" Jace interrupted wildly.

"What kind of information do you record, then?" Marie rephrased.

"Location of the planets of our solar system in the night sky every day since the inception of the Sect. We also include specific constellar formations, stellar clusters, and so on. Basically, if it exists in the night sky, it exists in our records," Jace answered casually.

"How do you record this information?" Marie followed up. "What kind of methods do you use to describe this information. Is it all diagrammatic? Or are you using some kind of unique unit of measurement?"

"Mostly diagrammatic," Jace muttered.

"What degree of accuracy are we working with then?"

"We pride ourselves in how accurately and precisely we are able to replicate and record the celestial positions," Jace responded with a proud front as he tried to keep his response as vague as possible.

"In their cultivation method, they define Meridians that are cultivated at different locations accross the human body that act as pseudo mana cores. These Meridians act as subordinates to the central core and aid in rapid circulation and expulsion of mana. The location of these Meridians cannot be messed around with and has an underlying theory that depends heavily on celestial positioning," Krish expounded, avoiding Jace's scrutinising gaze. "There is a lot of interdependency in the Meridian positioning as well. Minor deviations, and we're talking in the range of millimetres here, can result in irreparable backlash. So you can expect a high decree of accuracy and precision in their data."

Marie scratched her ching in thought as she digested the hasty revelations.

"Alright, it sounds useful for my purposes," Marie declared while tapping her laps earnestly. "How do I get access to it?"

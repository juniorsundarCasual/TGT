Jean placed the book on her work table and retrieved her note-taking book and pencil. One thing Jean learned about Marie, especially after her Big Sis' advancement, was that the girl never did anything casually. Every word and action had a meaning and purpose, even if it was seemingly said or done in passing. 

For instance, Marie once gave her a single copper coin saying that, "she found it lying around; it's of no use to me, maybe it may come into use for you." That very same day, Jean was making a purchase for some alchemical ingredients from the travelling merchant when she found that she was short exactly one copper coin.

Marie gave her this book for a reason. Although Jean wasn't informed of its purpose explicitly, she knew that (through her experience with Marie) it would come into use at the time Jean was most troubled or stuck - such as right now. Jean had already read the book and comprehended most of what it had to offer. But for her current predicament, she was certain that she would have to apply her understanding of the genetic algorithm in some shape or form.

The genetic algorithm is a problem-solving method inspired by how nature works. It's like a smart way of finding the best solution to a problem by imitating how living things evolve and adapt.

Imagine that there is a difficult problem that needs to be solved, like finding the best route to visit several places in a city. But there are so many possible routes, and it's hard to know which one is the best.

Now, consider how living things, like plants and animals, adapt and evolve over time. They have traits that help them survive and thrive. These traits are passed down from parents to their offspring through something called genes. In a genetic algorithm, a similar idea is used to solve the problem. Instead of genes, something called "chromosomes" are used. Each chromosome represents a potential solution to the problem, just like having different strategies to solve the route problem.

It all begins with a set of random chromosomes, each representing a different solution to the problem. Some solutions might be good, while others might not be so great. Each solution and give it a score based on how well it solves the problem.

Take the solutions with the highest scores and use them to create new solutions - by combining the best parts of the high-scoring solutions to make even better solutions. It's like taking the best features of different strategies and mixing them together. Repeat this process over and over again, just like nature's evolution. Each time, the solutions get better because only the best ones are selected and combined. It's like a trial-and-error process where, usually, each passing generation is used to learn from and improve upon for the next generation.

In addition to this, just like in natural evolutionary processes, in the genetic algorithm, mutations serve an important purpose. Even though the algorithm tries to improve the solutions by selecting and combining the best ones, there is a risk of getting stuck in a local optimum. This means that the algorithm might converge to a reasonably good solution but not the absolute best one.

Mutation helps to introduce diversity and prevent the algorithm from getting trapped in local optima. By applying small random changes to the solutions, the algorithm explores different parts of the solution space that it might not have considered otherwise. Going back to the optimal pathing problem, a mutation would be the introduction of an unexpected turn in the middle of the plan, which may somehow lead down a shortcut.

Mutations add an element of exploration and can help the algorithm discover new possibilities. They inject randomness into the process, allowing for potentially better solutions to emerge. However, it's important to note that mutations are usually applied with low probability. We don't want too many random changes as they can disrupt the progress made by the algorithm. It's a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation of the solution space.

By using this genetic algorithm, it is assumed that one can eventually find the best solution to a problem. It's like a smart way of exploring different possibilities and finding the optimal answer. However, there is no guarantee that it will result in the best answer. The reason for this is that genetic algorithms use a probabilistic approach to search through the solution space rather than a targeted strategy.

In real life, genetic algorithms are used in many areas, like optimizing complex systems, designing new products, or even creating artwork. They help us find the best solution by imitating nature's way of evolving and adapting. So, in simple terms, a genetic algorithm is a problem-solving approach that imitates how living things evolve and adapt. It helps find a best solution by combining and improving different strategies over time.

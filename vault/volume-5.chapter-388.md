The following day, Jean and Shuri arrived at the staff room very early, even before Markus, and virtually cordoned off a corner by setting up two chairs and a bunch of chalk boards.

Jean picked up a chalk and drew a large model of the brain on one of the boards. "The brain learns through an interesting concept called neuroplasticity. It is the ability to reorganise its structure, functions and connections in response to learning, experience and environmental changes."

She started to label the different parts of the diagram while expounding, "There is no standard way in which a brain works. There is just an underlying strategy. By this, I mean that there is no easy to way to isolate which set of neurons are responsible for a specific thought, and no two brains can have the same neuron's firing. Heck, they may not even be in the same location!"

"But there has to be some similarity in a broader context, right?" Shuri clarified.

"Of course, which is why you have the following structural classifications in place for the different parts of the brain. The groupings of neurons in handling movement tasks are in the motor cortex, which is right-over here," Jean affirmed.

"The synapses, the connections between neurons, change. They either grow stronger as long-term potentiation or weaker as long-term depression based on the frequency with which the neurons are activated. Learning also involves the creation of new connections, synaptogenesis, between neurons and pruning of unused or weak connections, synaptic pruning. This is why they say repetition is key to committing to memory. Furthermore, association is also helpful, so mapping an experience to an action or concept helps recollection," Jean clarified.

"Why is it that I am able to perfectly recollect information without having to repeat?" Shuri probed.

"That's something I'd like to take a deep dive into, actually. Your cerebral activity would be a perfect case study," Jean commented, before an expression that cause Shuri to shudder in her boots painted the Jean's face. Shuri took a few involuntary scoots back. "How would you be interested in having your brain inspected?"

"Umm-"

"Nothing invasive; don't worry, I won't cut you up!" Jean quickly recovered, "Remember, I can't harm anyone knowingly."

"While I'd love to make a contribution in the name of scientific advancement, I don't feel comfortable with someone rifling through my brain," Shuri clarified her hesitance.

"It's not like I can read your memories by inspecting your brain," Jean responded. "Oh, well. The offer is open. Let me know if you ever change your mind."

There was silence as the end of that topic hung in the air awkwardly.

"The brain truly is a natural marvel. It is hard to believe that its mechanism isn't built on magic," Shuri commented finally. "Imagine this, an amalgamation of muscle and flesh the size of two fists together is able to control a complex mechanism like the body. To top it off, it is self-aware, constantly learning and evolving, and able to faciliate the manipulation of magic. The brain is all we need to cultivate!"

"In a way, that's true, isn't it?" Jean said while humming in thought. "Actually, I'm interested to know. You never showed much interest in this field of study. Why the sudden intrigue?"

Shuri pulled her lips into her cheeks and sucked the inside of her lips in contemplation. "I want to replicate the brain, but with Automagy."

"That's... ambitious. Care to elaborate on why?" Jean probed.

"Well, that's the endgame, isn't it?" Shuri started. "A device capable of exhibiting intelligence... That's the dream of every Automage out there."

"I don't see what its use might be," Jean commented, causing Shuri to let out a disdainful scoff.

"Why do everyone hate necromancers? Let's not fool ourselves with the morality rhetoric that floats around in public debates. No, the truth is that necromancy is a gateway to a nigh unbeatable force multiplier. To be able to throw an endless barrage of bodies at a problem is a tempting power to have. This is also what Automage's seek to replicate. But as you know, it is much harder because the soul is adaptable, but a will is not. You can program a core to be a servant that does one job perfectly ad infinitum. Protect. Attack. Collect. But its near impossible to program a core to adapt to a situation and change its behaviour according to the environmental conditions," Shuri elaborated.

"So its all about having the bigger sword in the end," Jean said with a disappointed sigh.

"For others, sure," Shuri emphasised while shaking her head. "Imagine having an adaptable agent working as an assistant? You need someone to manipulate a data set to gain insights into it? Call your intelligent assistant! Want to find the right piece of information over a large respository of data? Recruit your intelligent assistant! Simply want to entertain yourself? Get your intelligent assistant."

"That's... ambitious," Jean admitted. "So you're hypothesising that the pathway to create this 'intelligent assistant' is by understanding how a brain works, because logically speaking something that is intelligent has a brain."

"It sounds stupid if you put it that way," Shuri stated with a wry smile.

"Well, anything sounds stupid if you oversimplify it. I'm sure you have a more verbose plan in place," Jean quickly corrected herself.

Shuri sheepishly averted her gaze and murmured, "I wish I had a plan."

"All that aside," Jean continued, "What else would you like to know about the brain?"

"I have a few questions," Shuri responded while unfurling a footlong parchment filled with text.

"A few..." Jean repeated in disbelief while getting herself a chair and sitting down. "Alright, let's begin."

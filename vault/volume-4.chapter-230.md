The caravan progressed at a steady pace. It facing little opposition or cause for delays when traversing through the Maika Duchy, which was expected. Being one of the more commercially bounteous territories of the Solar Empire meant that they had to maintain a level of safety and security within their region so that money could 'flow' unhindered. To that end, the stringency with which the retainers of the Maika Duchy upheld their patrols and responsibilities was unparalleled. To top it off, the punishments and fines for illegal activities were many times more severe.

It was when the convoy crossed the Duchy's border and entered the Rasmus March where things started to get sketchier. In fact, Guy observed this in the demeanour of the members of the convoy first. Their neutral stance became more vigilant. Even the escorting group, who had been working with Dune Caravan Management regularly, had entered an alert posture.

"I wish Big Sis was with us," Markus commented with a low mutter. "I'm suddenly having a really weird premonition that I'd love to have verified by her."

"The atmosphere has grown palpably charged," Guy affirmed. "A conflict is imminent, I can just feel it."

"Matron Reva says that if we speak bad things then they will become real," Dora piped in with a matter-of-fact frown plastered over her face. Tucked under her right arm was a comic book about Pokemon that Guy had produced for her, which she was reading for the sixth time now.

"Although both the Maika Duchy and my Clan's territory border the Blackstar Kingdom, the former is in a better position due to the superior natural protection offered by the Dawnbreaker Mountain Ranges to the north. The border of the Rasmus March to the Blackstar Kingdom is fairly accessible and it becomes difficult for my Clan to maintain a strict control of that border at all times. Unwanted elements often sneak in as refugees... it's not like we can turn away those unfortunate..." Jean explained.

"That's why this slave suggested informing the Marquis about the Young miss' travel itenerary-" Josie tried to point out worriedly, but Jean immediately interrupted her.

"If we informed my father, he would have redirected an incalculable number of resources for my sake. It would leave the rest of our territory unmanned and prone to danger. This would then lead to the Clan questioning my father's capacity to lead. I cannot let that happen."

"But-"

"That's enough, Josie," Jean warned sternly.

Josie wanted to try one more time to convince Jean, when suddenly her senses captured a group of men approaching the convoy. Jean read the change in Josie's expression within the second of the shift and immediately grabbed her by the arm.

"Young miss-"

"You mustn't interfere," Jean reminded. "This is our responsibility as members of the True World Sect, not yours."

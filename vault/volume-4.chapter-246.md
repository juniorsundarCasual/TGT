"This seems quite..."

"Basic and rudimentary?" The woman completed Guy's sentence.

Guy gave off a wry smile and nodded in affirmation. "There doesn't seem to be many restrictions here."

The first part of the contract dealt with the sovereignty of a sect in the grand scheme of things. Essentially it could be boiled down to four statements.

A sect that is part of the Solar Sect Alliance must not interfere with Imperial business just as the Crown cannot interfere with the Alliance's interests. Doing so will result in the excommunication of the sect from the Alliance, and hand-over of all belligerent parties to the Empire's Authorities.

Sects registered under the Solar Sect Alliance cannot act against the Alliance's interests. Doing so will result in the sect's excommunication followed by appropriate repercussions, determined on a case-by-case basis.

Members of a sect registered under the Solar Sect Alliance cannot act against the Alliance's interests. Doing so will result in the immediate excommunication of the members' sect from the Alliance, with the member set to face the appropriate repercussions determined on a case-by-case basis.

The Alliance or the Empire cannot interfere with a sect's internal affairs as long as the aforementioned regulations aren't contradicted.

Following that, the contract delved into the expectations and requirements of a sect.

While a sect is part of the Alliance, they may not have a say in the Alliance's decision-making body. To gain access to that a donation is required. The contract didn't expand beyond this.

"Don't bother," the woman said with a shake of his head. "Do you think you can compete with sects like Cloudstrider and Whispering Dusk?"

"There doesn't seem to be anything detailing how conflicts between sects are to be handled," Guy pointed out a glaring fault.

"Conflicts between sects always has and will be handled the same way." The woman wrapped her fingers into a tight fist and flexed it. "The Solar Sect Alliance is held together by the Four Great Sects: the Cloudstrider Sect, the Whispering Dusk Sect, the Soaring Sword Sect, and the Red Dawn Sect. The origin of these sects predates the Empire, and are thus unshakeable. Any new sects forming within the Alliance will ultimately fall under the shade of one, or multiple of these sects. However, not just any upstart sect can secure such a position. For that, they will need to set themselves apart from the rest - show that they are special."

The woman brought her index fingers together and rested her elbows on the table. "Conflict between major sects can have far-reaching consequences. However, conflicts between minor sects leaves nary a ripple. So, if such issues do pop up, the Alliance believes it best that the feuding parties handle their business by themselves. However, you can see that there is a clause restricting collateral damage caused by a sect. Be mindful of that if you happen to get into a tussle with a competitor."

Guy frowned at the implications of that statement. "The Alliance intends to filter our the so-called 'dregs' by having us fights amidst ourselves?"

"Yes," the woman affirmed without hesitation. "As you already know, just about anyone can start a sect. But there are limited resources to go around. The Alliance can only offer so many subsidies and opportunities to its members. The more mouths there are to feed, the less each person gets. Instead, why not create an environment where only the strongest get to eat? Those that starve will be forced to eat those that are weaker than them, and over time only the strongest, most desperate will remain."

"Brutal!" Markus blurted out in disgust.

"That is the way of the world," the woman droned.

"I don't believe the other guys outside will be told any of this?" Guy probed cautiously.

"Like I said, I was asked to do a favour, and I am obliging," she reiterated with a snort. "People think that forming and maintaining a sect is trivial. It sure is on paper, but everyone conveniently forgets that a sect, just like any organisation, does not exist in a vaccuum. There are many factors that come into play, some foreseeable others not so much. I'm only preparing you for the worst. Do you think those nitwits outside would take as long as you have to scrutinise the contract before signing it?"

She rested her back on her chair and said, "There is nothing more I can tell you. Though I will leave you with this one statement: nothing is fair, everything is permitted. You happen to have a fortunate starting position with the presence of such a powerful figure backing you. If I were in your place, I would prostrate myself and do everything within my power to keep them in the fold."

With that, the woman closed her eyes and awaited Guy's decision. After another quick scan of the contract, Guy brought his brush to the paper and signed it.

"I thought there would be something more magical than this," Guy said with a disappointed expression.

"We don't need magic to enforce a contract," the woman said with a hearty laugh. "That being said, don't even think about skirting the clauses. I'd prefer to not have to take your life the next time we meet."

Guy sputtered and let out a strained laugh.

"Now that all the formalities are covered. The True World Sect is now officially part of the Solar Sect Alliance. All that is left for you is to fill up the minimum member quota within one year."

Guy nodded. "We are planning to join in on the recruitment event taking place over the coming days."

The woman halted in her steps, turned, and hinted, "Do you know how spots are assigned?"

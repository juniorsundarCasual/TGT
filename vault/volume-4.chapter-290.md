Josie knew immediately that the man before her was the same vermin she fought earlier in the quarantine. The stench exuded by his mana matched that creature's down to a 'T''. Josie knew that it wasn't the last she'd seen of that vermin. Except, she didn't expect their next encounter to be so soon, and that too with herself at such a massive disadvantage. In their last encounter, the creature was in the peak of Foundation Establishment realm - merely a centimetre away from stepping into Core Formation. Even with a beast's inherent advantages covering for the gap in cultivation, the fight was incrementally in Josie's favour. However, the creature had somehow broken through. Even after losing so much, it had advanced into the Core Formation realm.

With this change, the creature turned man completely outclassed Josie. Which became immediately evident when the creature followed up its charge with a wide swipe of its left hand. Josie intended to block the attack, but she quickly realised that the force was well beyond her limit even after reinforcing her body with mana. This was the gulf between a mage and a beast within the same cultivation realm! In response, Josie let herself get pushed back by the attack and caught herself as she careened away.

"What exactly are you?" Josie said through gritting teeth.

The man tilted his head, with a crazed and confused expression on his face. His clothes were ragged and torn - there were weapon marks as well as tears caused by a human pulling on it. Josie matched his face with that of the man who she amputated a few days back. He was also wearing the same armour, except it had degraded significantly through battle and environmental damage. His hair was messier and tangled, singed in someplaces too. He revealed his bloodsoaked teeth with an agitated smile, and then used his tongue to lick the blood leaking out from the side of his lips.

He got down on all fours and covered the gap within a fraction of a second. The speed was faster than Josie could track. The ground quite literally caved in where he used to stand due to the immense force exerted by his legs. The following attack turned into a grapple, as he tried to overpower Josie into the ground. As a ranged attacker, Josie had to separate herself. She tried dodging and weaving around natural obstacles, but the man waved his hands with a maddened fervour, obliterating the trees and rock in his path.

Left without an option, Josie quickly conjured up a gust of air and used it to accelerate mid-dodge to confuse the man. Evidently it worked. Josie capitalised on the sudden decrease in immediate pressure and started to fire off wind based attacks with impunity. This time, she did not hold back, she did not have the luxury of holding back.

As if mocking her, the man crossed his arms and weathered the attacks unflingingly. Josie caught the sudden increase in projected mana in front of his fists that was blocking the attacks from coming his way.

Josie bit down on her lips and continued to fire her attacks. There were |Wind Blades|, |Dec|

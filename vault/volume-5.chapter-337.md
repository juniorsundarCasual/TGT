Shuri's brain was on the verge of an explosion. Not just metaphorically, but literally as well. She was hitting critical mass, where there was a massive backlog of information awaiting categorisation and storage. A human brain usually doesn't undergo this strain, since the brain has a natural limiter on what and how much it can memorise in one go.

However, Shuri's mind lacked such safety features. Everything she saw and understood, she memorised. Her brain was like a sponge that didn't stop soaking, because it really couldn't stop - the average human brain can store over three hundred years worth of continuous audiovisual data. What Shuri was absorbing through reading books was only a measly fraction of that amount. So, if her eyes could work continuously for hours on end, and her brain had a nigh-unlimited storage space, the bottleneck was actually in the black-box between the sensor and storage.

How does the mind memorise and remember? It is a complex process, where an information is encoded, deconstructed and stored as a combination of neural impulses. Recollection requires an impetus, which is generally some sort of cue that the mind uses to determine which combination of neural impulses will get you the information that you want. It is believed that during encoding and deconstruction, the brain can discard or lose some pieces. It is possibly an evolutionary adaptation to make our lives easier.

Shuri's brain is genetically incapable of discarding or losing data during this conversion. So everything that goes in gets committed, which is a double-edged sword. To expound in simpler terms, her converter was optimised to reduce data loss, but it wasn't optimised to handle scale. So, by effectively bombarding the converter with a large influx of data, she had seriously strained it.

She hobbled over from the library, a few books still in hand, towards her living quarters. She had nearly completed all the books in the reading list handed to her by Sect Leader Larks and had committed all the information in it to memory. The issue was that she did all of this within just two days; she had effectively binged the reading list which contained over 30 books, each starting at college level and above.

Shuri had given in to her base urge to devour new and unknown knowledge, which was now biting back at her.

As soon as she entered her room, her footing grew unsteadier. The books in her hands dropped and she collapsed.

She'd blacked out.

____

Information arrived in random packages, as she entered and exited consciousness.

The first thing she realised when she gained a moment of clarity was that she was no longer on the floor. She had been moved to her bed. She also noticed that there was another person in the room - an adult.

____

Her second bout of consciousness introduced her to a rather heated argument between a man and a woman.

____

Her body felt cold, and then hot, and then cold again. Was this a fever?

She instinctively huddled into a ball to contain the smidgen of heat still coursing through her body, but was surprised to find a heavy comforter hugging her tightly.

____

She felt herself getting raised into a seated position, and a warm metal spoon touching her lips. Her nose picked up edible smells in the steam that entered it. Her eyelids cracked open with some difficulty, to find a person holding a spoon up against her face.

"Eat," the masculine voice spoke. "It's just vegetable soup."

"She's weak. Why can't we use a feeding bottle?" A feminine voice argued worriedly.

"She doesn't need it," the masculine voice affirmed. "Come on, Shuri. Take a sip."

Her mouth moved by instinct and slurped the warm liquid. As it flowed down her gullet, a comforting feeling washed over her. Another spoonful arrived at the ready, which she slurped hungrily.

Once the soup was finished. A wave of slumber washed over her, and she fell asleep once again.

"Guy, Shuri isn't here," Grace pointed out while nudging head towards the empty seat in the mess hall, which was usually occupied by the girl. It was off in an unfrequented corner, out of sight and very easy to overlook. "I thought I told you to get it through her head the last time. She cannot miss her meals, no matter what!"

Guy sighed loudly as he tilted his head backwards in defeat. "I tried, Grace."

"Well, try harder!"

"You could very easily do it as well, you know?!" Guy responded weakly.

"I'm not the Sect Leader. It isn't my job to keep these kids in line," Grace snapped back. "I already have my hands full, with Kano and Dora. Besides, do you think they will respect my word, that of a mortal, or yours?"

"That excuse didn't work the last time when you asked me to reprimand the kids for planting weeds in your garden (which they had no idea about, might I add), and it won't work this time either," Guy responded with a stern shake of his head. "And as a matter of fact, they all fear YOU more than they fear me."

"This argument is getting nowhere," Grace deflected. "The bottom line is that a girl still in her growing stages is skipping her meals. Are you going to do something about it or not?"

Guy sighed once again while standing up from his table, "Fine, fine. I'll go."

"Leave the dishes, I'll wash them," Grace declared while snatching the plate from Guy's hands. She then chuckled and said, "Look! I have my hands full!"

Guy responded with an exaggerated smile and a sarcastic laugh, "Your sense of humour has hit a new low, Grace."

Grace responded with a fake smile of her own before shooting Guy an aggressive look, and leaving in a huff with the dishes expertly stacked in her hands.

Guy proceeded to make a plate for Shuri, with a balanced nutrition, and made his way out of the mess hall towards the living quarters. Along the way, he greeted the Sect Members hanging around, doing their own thing.

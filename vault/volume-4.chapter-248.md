Markus' perception of time started to slow down as the referee brought their hand down to initiate the fight. His eyes darted for one last time around the arena, observing and deconstructing the minute movements of his opponents.

The moment the fight began, five pairs of feet left the ground all at once. As Markus anticipated, everyone started to dogpile on the girl oozing with arrogance. Two girls bounded in with a sword and a saber respectively, the third girl had a fist coated in purple flames, the boy rocketed forward in a meteor-like dropkick, while the girl with the whip tied around her hips faltered and stumbled as she prepared to defend herself against her attackers.

Markus flicked his wand to his right, and an intricate mandala of spell circles formed around him and his wand in an instant. The second the spell circles solidified, a massive ball of semi-molten rock, like an asteroid breaching the atmosphere, collided against him.

While most expected to see the boy expelled from stage in a spectacularly ragdoll-like manner, to their shock, the ball started to warp, bend, and get siphoned into a tiny circle of nothingness at the tip of Markus' wand. The entire fiery rock was deleted within two seconds, at which point the circle of nothingness started to fluctuate unstably. Markus didn't waste another moment and jerked his wand towards the beatdown occurring on the far side of the arena. 

sssssssssssssssSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

An inhuman shriek followed as the circle of nothingness hurtled at the speed of sound, gaining a third-dimension as it approached the youths. Those at the receiving end of the attack were frozen in place as something incomprehensible entered their mana senses rendering the control over their mana domains obsolete. They could barely make it out of the way before an explosion followed by a crushing shockwave caught them. Five bodies were flung out from the arena, unconscious and battered. The arena itself did not fare any better and over three-quarters of it had turned into rubble.

The distracted audience paused and rubbed their eyes in disbelief. An unusual silence hung in the air, almost as though the ball of nothingness had taken all sound with it.

Markus turned to his right and narrowed his attention on the boy who had been quaking in his boots at the start of the fight, though this time the quaking was genuine and not just a facade to get others to lower their guards.

This was the third breed of fighters Markus was on the lookout for, the under-sellers. The kind of people that, either as a strategy or as another form of arrogance, outwardly diminish their skill to lull their opponents into a false sense of security. Upon witnessing the exagerrated signs of weaknesss, the opponent often grows arrogant and takes the conflict on a lighter note.

From the start, Markus knew that the fearful boy was a deceiver, and that his aura of vulnerability was all fake. THis was because, the boy could not keep his persona consistent. There were a few times when Markus tracked his opponents outside the arena. While one of the fights were taking place on stage, Markus happened to notice this same boy showing a disdainful expression very smugly. If that was the boy's baseline, why would he suddenly freeze over and shiver in fear upon meeting a fresh and unknown group of mages that he has never even faced before? This was all a plot, a ruse, a grift - Markus could sense it.

Just as Markus had predicted, when the fight began, he was one of two on stage that did not pile-up on one person into a stressful melee. Instead he prepared for the anticipated attack from his opponent who had just realised that

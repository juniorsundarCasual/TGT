Guy was shocked to see a familiar franchise from his previous world gracing his humble organisation's portfolio. For a second, he feared that he had unwittingly crossed paths with the only other transmigrator who somehow had the "smart" idea to plagiarise a business venture from his past life and not even change its name!

Seeing his Disciple's awkward chuckle, Guy figured that there was definitely an interesting story.

"Lowe's was a takeover," Markus revealed. "Do you remember the company we hired to manage clearing the forestry and setting up the foundation of the sect? Well, now we own majority shares of the company."

"Last I remembered, Lowe's didn't follow that ownership model," Guy mumbled.

"They didn't, but they were... convinced that our proposed model would provide greater financial options," Markus responded. His choice of words were precise, indicating that he was trying to dance around the main point.

"What are you not telling me, Markus?" Guy bore down with a mild frown.

"Master, do you remember the additional member I recruited during my return trip?" Markus said after a long sigh.

"I believe Shuri was her name, last name unknown," Guy affirmed.

'The insincere girl!' The Other Guy chimed in his head. The first time they saw the girl in the crowd and observed her mannerisms and tone, the Other Guy immediately gauged that the girl was wearing a thick facade. Her words implied sincerity, but her voice didn't. Needless to say, the Other Guy didn't like her - not one bit. After all, a man so ardently and zealously pursuing the 'truth' would take offence with someone who lives a life of lies. 'There is something odd about the girl...'

Guy schooled his twitching right side and awaited for Markus' further explanation.

"Well, through some methods that even I am unaware of, Shuri convinced Mister Lowe to shift his business model towards our limited liability based system," Markus started.

"Methods you are unaware of?" Guy parrotted in disbelief.

"I did not pay attention at first, Master. But the development came out of the blue. Therefore, I kept a closer eye on the developments from that point onwards," Markus elaborated. "Once Mister Lower did that, she further convinced him to distribute a part of his ownership amongst his three sons in equal to instigate some competition and prepare them for inheritance. After he did so, she induced the eldest son borne of a concubine to sell a portion of his shares to her in order to accumulate finances and jumpstart a subsidiary selling tools and hardware. The venture was quite successful, and pushed the eldest to the forefront of the inheritance race. The other two sons of the main wife were agitated, which Shuri capitalised by providing one with strategies to convert Lowe's into a successful brand name, and the other to optimise upstream channels by leveraging the Verum Trading Company's diverse portfolio. This consultation and assistance hinged on an exchange of shares from the two sons. As the market value of Lowe's increased, she nudged Mister Lowe to sell his shares to accumulate more personal wealth since dipping into the business' funds would classify as embezzlement and would thus infringe upon the limited liability system bylaws that have been ratified by the government."

That's right. During the past few years, Guy had petitioned with the government to approve of the limited liability based business model. In this world, businesses were tied to an individual or family, or an organisation. If said individual, family or organisation drowned due to personal problems, their businesses would suffer through association alone - thus they had unlimited liability. Through great difficulty, Guy bought a one-hour sit-down with the Head of the Department of Economy of the Maika Duchy and explained the limited liability model. The man was sceptical at first, but realised that it would be extremely lucrative for the government (and by extension, himself) to implement this strategy.

By default, the government will own a minority, non-dilutible share of any venture that adopts this model. If the business succeeds, the government secures a lucrative asset. If it fails, the government can gut the business and sell all of its fixed assets to earn free money.

This initiative moved up the bureaucratic vine with uncharacterstic speed, and then an Empire wide bill was passed that enshrined this limited liability model into law. Of course, most businessmen were apprehensive to switch to this model as it would jeopardise their ownership of their business on paper.

"Ultimately, Shuri accumulated enough shares as the representative of Verum Trading Company to gain majority ownership. This was then brought into Furion's attention who capitalised on this and- well, as you can see, we now have another business within our portfolio," Markus concluded.

"Speaking of Furion, how is he doing? I haven't been able to talk to him after returning to the Sect," Guy segued.

"He actually achieved a breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm," Markus said with a snap of his fingers.

"Really? How so?"

"Well, I remember hearing him tell me about how he'd recently been getting a rush with every business deal he'd closed. In his words, it was 'almost orgasmic'. I thought it was just some perverted fetish of his, but turns out that it was actually his cultivation resonating with him. After the takeover of Lowe's, he ended up breaking through into Foundation Establishment," Markus elaborated. "Though there have been some... weird developments on that front."

"Weird?"

Markus pulled in a mouthful of hair through his teeth and said, "His skin has turned a faint orangish shade and his hair is turning pale-blonde. I thought such outward changes only transpired with advancement into Core Formation. Furion suspected something else was in play and got himself tested by a Teacher specialising in bloodlines and physiques. And wouldn't you know, Furion had a faint "

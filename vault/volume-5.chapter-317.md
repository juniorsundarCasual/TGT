Guy was shocked to see a familiar franchise from his previous world gracing his humble organisation's portfolio. For a second, he feared that he had unwittingly crossed paths with the only other transmigrator who somehow had the "smart" idea to plagiarise a business venture from his past life and not even change its name!

Seeing his Disciple's awkward chuckle, Guy figured that there was definitely an interesting story.

"Lowe's was a takeover," Markus revealed. "Do you remember the company we hired to manage clearing the forestry and setting up the foundation of the sect? Well, now we own majority shares of the company."

"Last I remembered, Lowe's didn't follow that ownership model," Guy mumbled.

"They didn't, but they were... convinced that our proposed model would provide greater financial options," Markus responded. His choice of words were precise, indicating that he was trying to dance around the main point.

"What are you not telling me, Markus?" Guy bore down with a mild frown.

"Master, do you remember the additional member I recruited during my return trip?" Markus said after a long sigh.

"I believe Shuri was her name, last name unknown," Guy affirmed.

'The insincere girl!' The Other Guy chimed in his head. The first time they saw the girl in the crowd and observed her mannerisms and tone, the Other Guy immediately gauged that the girl was wearing a thick facade. Her words implied sincerity, but her voice didn't. Needless to say, the Other Guy didn't like her - not one bit. After all, a man so ardently and zealously pursuing the 'truth' would take offence with someone who lives a life of lies. 'There is something odd about the girl...'

Guy schooled his twitching right side and awaited for Markus' further explanation.

"Well, through some methods that even I am unaware of, Shuri convinced Mister Lowe to shift his business model towards our limited liability based system," Markus started.

"Methods you are unaware of?" Guy parrotted in disbelief.

"I did not pay attention at first, Master. But the development came out of the blue. Therefore, I kept a closer eye on the developments from that point onwards," Markus elaborated. "Once Mister Lower did that, she further convinced him to distribute a part of his ownership amongst his three sons in equal to instigate some competition and prepare them for inheritance. After he did so, she induced the eldest son borne of a concubine to sell a portion of his shares to her in order to accumulate finances and jumpstart a subsidiary selling tools and hardware. The venture was quite successful, and pushed the eldest to the forefront of the inheritance race. The other two sons of the main wife were agitated, which Shuri capitalised by providing one with strategies to convert Lowe's into a successful brand name, and the other to optimise upstream channels by leveraging the Verum Trading Company's diverse portfolio. This consultation and assistance hinged on an exchange of shares from the two sons. As the market value of Lowe's increased, she nudged Mister Lowe to sell his shares to accumulate more personal wealth since dipping into the business' funds would classify as embezzlement and would thus infringe upon the limited liability system bylaws that have been ratified by the government."

That's right. During the past few years, Guy had petitioned with the government to approve of the limited liability based business model. In this world, businesses were tied to an individual or family, or an organisation. If said individual, family or organisation drowned due to personal problems, their businesses would suffer through association alone - thus they had unlimited liability. Through great difficulty, Guy bought a one-hour sit-down with the Head of the Department of Economy of the Maika Duchy and explained the limited liability model. The man was sceptical at first, but realised that it would be extremely lucrative for the government (and by extension, himself) to implement this strategy.

By default, the government will own a minority, non-dilutible share of any venture that adopts this model. If the business succeeds, the government secures a lucrative asset. If it fails, the government can gut the business and sell all of its fixed assets to earn free money.

This initiative moved up the bureaucratic vine with uncharacterstic speed, and then an Empire wide bill was passed that enshrined this limited liability model into law. Of course, most businessmen were apprehensive to switch to this model as it would jeopardise their ownership of their business on paper.

"Ultimately, Shuri accumulated enough shares as the representative of Verum Trading Company to gain majority ownership. This was then brought into Furion's attention who capitalised on this and- well, as you can see, we now have another business within our portfolio," Markus concluded.

"Speaking of Furion, how is he doing? I haven't been able to talk to him after returning to the Sect," Guy segued.

"He actually achieved a breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm," Markus said with a snap of his fingers.

"Really? How so?"

"Well, I remember hearing him tell me about how he'd recently been getting a rush with every business deal he'd closed. In his words, it was 'almost orgasmic'. I thought it was just some perverted fetish of his, but turns out that it was actually his cultivation resonating with him. After the takeover of Lowe's, he ended up breaking through into Foundation Establishment," Markus elaborated. "Though there have been some... weird developments on that front."

"Weird?"

Markus pulled in a mouthful of air through his teeth and said, "His skin has turned a faint orangish shade and his hair is turning pale-blonde. I thought such outward changes only transpired with advancement into Core Formation. Furion suspected something else was in play and got himself tested by a Teacher specialising in bloodlines and physiques. And wouldn't you know, Furion had a faint trace of Voracious Citrus in his bloodline."

"What's a Voracious Citrus?" Guy said with a snort. In his mind, he imagined a comical scenario of a citrus fruit copulating with another human being.

Markus chuckled and said, "The Voracious Citrus is an extremely rare fruit that originates from the dank rainforests of the Fae Realm. It grows to a creeper plant that consumes everything in its vicinity, hence its name. Once the orange-coloured fruit consumes enough biomass it reaches a critical point wherein it converts the mass into mana that skyrockets its cultivation into the Core Formation realm. The fruit grows in very special climates in Gaea and is sought after for its condensed energy density and mass-to-mana conversion properties for alchemy."

"How is Furion's bloodline being activated, then?" Guy circled back.

"Apparently, mergers, acquisitions and takeovers resonate with the voracious nature of the aptly named Citrus," Markus answered while schooling a neutral expression.

"Well..." Guy mumbled. "Good for him. I bet his father's excited about this development."

"He sure was!" Markus affirmed. "There's been talks about securing alliances through marriage with some noble clans as well. Though it seems that very few women are willing to overlook the discolouration of his skin."

"Well, money and power definitely works wonders in tinting a person's gaze," Guy said wryly. "As Furion accumulates more of both, the discolouration will fade away in their eyes."

"That's a cynical way to look at things," Markus commented sadly.

"Well, an alliance through marriage is less about two people liking each other, and more about two families coming together. What matters more here is that the two people getting married learn to live harmoniously with each other. Admittedly it is a sad state of affairs when you think about it, but what can you do? Marriage has, and most likely will remain the most direct and effective way to secure relations between two parties," Guy explained. This was true even in his world, which one could argue was far more advanced than the one he was in right now.

"Nonetheless, it is impressive that Shuri managed to secure such a lucrative asset for the Sect. We should definitely reward her!" Guy declared. "How do you think we should go about it?"

"I'll brainstorm with Marie about this, as she has worked more closely with Shuri," Markus deferred.

"Proceed as you see fit," Guy dismissed with a final nod. With that said, Markus bowed one last time and left the room.

"I do not like that girl," Guy's right half spoke.

"Doesn't matter to me if you like her or you don't. She is a member of the Sect and must be treated as such. We do not segregate, nor do we give preferential treatment," Guy's left half reminded. "But what's gotten you so riled up about it anyways?"

"When I saw her, I tried to graze over her soul as I usually do. This is how I get a read on people," the right half explained. "Anyway, her soul kept blaring at me that her life was a lie - that she was living a lie. I mean, it's hard to put it in words as it is more of an intuitive feeling."

"This is a gross invasion of privacy!" The left half yelled. "Speaking of which, what the hell did you do with Markus? That too without permission? Are you crazy?! I thought I made it clear that the nonsense you pulled with Dora was the last. You can't just experiment on people like this without consent."

"Whatever," the right half dismissed. "An ant is an ant, and its soul would agree. A monkey is a monkey. However, the girl's soul did not agree that she was who she was."

"You're being cryptic again," the left half admonished.

"Yeah, well screw you too!"

Guy sighed in exasperation while his left index continued to tap on the newly added Lowe's Hardware, Landscaping and Construction in the business portfolio chart.

"Shuri..." He said out loud. 'Maybe I should have a one-on-one session with her. I've talked to the other members personally, and only she remains.'

Shuri'd just been screaming away her anger into the down-filled bag, when suddenly an irritating tickling sensation pervaded her nostrils and forced her to release a large gust of air violently through both her nose and mouth.

She suddenly pulled her face out of her pillows and sneezed loudly. 

"A-A-AAACHOOOOOOO!"

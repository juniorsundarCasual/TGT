Krish looked up towards the skies. The girl's words still resonated everywhere - he could hear it. It was as if the air itself could not accept the words and was actively rejecting it. The air grew heavier with each passing second. The clouds grew darker, and the sunlight grew dimmer.

"You've just gone and done it, haven't you..." Krish said with a bitter smile. "Why?"

"This was the only way," Marie explained. Her gaze grew distant, as through she was ready to accept her demise. "This was the only guaranteed way to ensure that Kano and Dora would return alive."

"You could have asked for them to be brought back her right now," Krish reminded. "Your words stated that they would only remain safe until they could return."

Marie chuckled self-depracatingly and said, "I forgot the conjugations."

Krish gently raised his hand and rubbed his Disciple's head. "You stupid child. Didn't I tell you of the consequences of using the Ancient Tongue?"

"I know," Marie expressed forlornly. "I'm sorry, but I don't regret my decision. If my death can keep them safe, then so be it. They were the reason why I even decided to become your Disciple."

"How selfish can you be?!" Krish snapped back. He then let out a tired sigh and said, "Did you really think I'd let you die like that?"

"W-Wha-"

|Everything Marie Reva, my Disciple, said in the Ancient Tongue within the past ten minutes was spoken in its entirety by me, Krish Nara. Everyone who heard it, heard me say it. And the world itself recognises me as the speaker,| Krish said.

"M-Master, no-"

Krish waved his hands and Marie's voice went mute. She tried to scream, yell, vocalise something, but no sound escaped her mouth.

"Just be quiet for a minute and listen!" Krish rasped. He then looked at his Disciple with a apologetic expression and said, "I'm sorry, but I don't regret my decision."

A rueful laugh escaped him before he added, "I didn't take on a Disciple, just to lose her. They say the worst Masters are the ones that have to buy their Disciples."

"What's happening?" Guy asked as he approached the Master-Disciple duo chatting emotionally amongst themselves. "What spell did Elder Nara just cast? It was a lot longer than any spell I've ever heard."

"It wasn't him, it was me!" Marie yelled. Her face warped with surprise as she suddenly realised that her voice had returned to her.

"What are you talking about? Clearly Elder Nara was the one who just cast that spell," the man reaffirmed with certainty. "We all heard it."

"N-NO you don't understand!"

"There's no point," Krish interjected his Disciple's panicking. "OK, I can feel it coming now!"

Krish suddenly plummeted to the ground and started to breath heavily.

"Master, what's happening?!" Marie exclaimed while cradling the elderly mage.

"No one is supposed to speak the Ancient Tongue, it's supposed to be an extinct - dead - language. Anyone who utters it now will face the same fate. Complete extinction. I am going to be completely removed from this world," Krish explained whle wheezing out in pain. "My body... is disintigrating as we speak."

"W-Why don't you Ascend?" Marie quickly suggested, clearly grasping at straws.

"Girl!" Krish snapped while flicking his Discple's forehead. "Did I not make myself... clear. No trace of me... can exist. Not even an Inheritance Artefact. I... will disappear..."

"N-No..." Marie expressed and her shoulders slumped in defeat, tears started to well up in her eyes and she shook her head repeatedly in defiance. "This can't be happening."

"What did you expect would happen?" Krish said. Suddenly, a lone tear rolled down his right cheek, "Wow... Its been over a millenium since I last cried... its a weird sensation, I will admit... Oooo, ok its hurting now..."

Krish groaned loudly and tried to massage his chest, but he saw that his right hand had turned into dust and disintegrated completely.

"I would... have loved... to see... you... grow up... to be... a... revolutionary... weilder... of the... Heavenly Eye... For... the short... moment... you've been... my Disciple... you've... made me... so... proud..." Krish said with great difficulty. Starting from his toes, his body started to disintegrate and turn into dust.

"Keep... my... bag... It will help... you... It... has all... the artefacts... from the previous... owners... of the Heavenly... Eye... It's... unfortunate... that I won't... be able to... join...-"

And before he could finish he last words, Krish's body turned completely into dust and disappeared.

Marie remained static as she kneeled over where Krish's body was laying just a moment ago.

"W-What just happened?" Guy inquired worriedly. "He just... disappeared. What happened?!"

"He's... gone," Marie croaked. "Forever."

"I don't understand."

Marie stood up, picked up the cloth bag Krish always carried with him and slumped it over her shoulder. Without uttering a single word, she turned and left.

"Marie-" Guy reached forward, but Marie dodged the hand and hasted her pace using the movement technique her Master had taught her. "Wait-"

"Are we just going to overlook the fact that a Tesseract Transformation mage just up and disappeared?!" Rianna finally yelled in exasperation. "He didn't even Ascend! Where the hell is the Inheritance Artefact?"

"Mage Maddi, please be respectful!" Grace snapped. "Marie has just lost her Master."

Rianna coughed as Shay-Hade also jabbed her hard with his elbows. He gave her a stern glare before apologising to Grace. The other Sect Members continued to investigate the sudden disappearance of the two children, while a single member split off from the group and followed Marie.

Marie stepped into the small hut nestled in the heart of Twilight Village, a place once teeming with the vibrant presence of her Master. Time had not been kind to this humble abode; ever since the Sect relocated to the mountain, this hut had been left to the mercy of neglect and dust. The memories, however, lingered stubbornly, as vivid as the day they were made.

The air inside was stale, thick with dust motes dancing in the slivers of light piercing through the cracks. Marie made her way to her Master's old mattress, an island in a sea of forgotten times. She sat down, the familiar yet now foreign fabric beneath her offering little comfort. Her elbows found their way to her knees, and she buried her face in her hands, a dam holding back an ocean of sorrow.

A muffled wail broke from her, her palms barely containing the torrent of grief. The tears came unbidden, each one a testament to her loss. Her siblings, though safe, were far from her, and her Master, her mentor, her guide, had paid the ultimate price for their protection.

"Why?!" she cried out, her voice cracking under the weight of her anguish. "Why, why, why... WHY?!"

In the midst of her despair, Marie felt a presence beside her, quiet yet unmistakable. Before she could lift her head, a gentle hand wrapped around her, drawing her close. She felt her head being guided onto a comforting shoulder, a familiar, reassuring touch amidst the chaos of her emotions.

"It's okay," Shuri's voice was a soft whisper, a soothing balm to Marie's frayed nerves. "Let it all out."

Marie's defenses crumbled at the kindness in Shuri's embrace. She allowed herself to be vulnerable, to grieve without restraint. Her cries filled the hut, each sob a release of the pain she had been carrying. Shuri held her, a steadfast presence in the storm of Marie's sorrow, offering silent support and understanding.

As Marie's fit diminished, Shuri asked, "Would you liked to talk about what happened?"

"He's gone," Marie answered with a cracked voice. "He'd disappeared. And it's all my fault."

"Why?" Shuri responded. "Why do you think it is your fault?"

"Because..." Marie tried to come up with a response, an explanation of any kind, but her mind just didn't function. There were no thoughts left in her head anymore.

"I want to be alone for a little bit. Can you leave me here?" Marie asked.

"I don't think I can do that," Shuri responded. "When I was going through something like this, you didn't let me wallow in my own thoughts all alone. Even if you don't want to talk to me, let me be there with you. You can ignore me, I'll just sit over there in that corner silently."

"Please-"

"Don't argue over this," Shuri interjected while sucking in a sharp breath of air in protest. "You carry on as you were. Cry if you must, yell or swear if that helps. But don't collapse on me. I know that you are stronger than that. Do you think Elder Nara would wish to see you in this state?"

"Don't!" Marie snapped angrily.

Shuri raised her hand apologetically, "I guess its too soon. Well, I meant no offence."

Shuri pulled over a seat for herself, the same one Marie's Master loved to sit cross-legged on, and sat over at the corner as she had promised. Marie looked at the girl pointedly, before shaking her head and leaving the hut.

Marie chose to take a long walk, but was irked to notice that Shuri was still following her. Marie, in turn, activated her movement technique and built a hefty distance between herself and Shuri. But a few minutes later, she found the girl following her while breathing heavily. Since Shuri could no longer rely on her core to sustain herself, she was closer to a regular human. And so, exhaustion was something that couldn't be avoided.

"Why are you following me?!" Marie voiced her annoyance.

"I... told you. I can't... leave you... alone... when you... need me the most," Shuri said while wheezing. "Can... you slow down... please?!"

Marie clicked her tongue before sitting down by a nearby tree and resting her back against the trunk. "Take five!" She commanded Shuri, to which the girl smiled gratefully and plopped down on her back. Marie revealed a faint smile before it faded and turned into one filled with melancholy. She looked towards the clear blue skies and let herself dwell on a singular thought.

Her Master was gone... forever... and it was all her fault...

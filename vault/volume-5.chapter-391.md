Rianna carried the unconcious girl to the infirmary hastily. She was followed by her partner, who was displaying a concerned sulk in place of his usual stoicism. They were also chased by the other girl, who they had outpaced a few seconds ago. Rianna's gaze landed on the little girl's swollen right arm. A quick |Inspect| with her mana sense confirmed that the bones between her wrist and elbow, the ulna and the radius, had snapped thoroughly. As immediate first-aid, Rianna had attached a splint in place to reduce the movement in the affected area. Luckily, the girl lost consciousness upon falling to the ground. She most definitely suffered a concussion, but the unconsciousness would mask the pain the girl should be experiencing right now.

Marie had given Rianna and Shay-Hade an initial tour of the Sect, which was why the duo knew the location of the infirmary. Rianna only hoped that whichever physician worked there had the knowledge to treat such fractures.

"Help!" Rianna exclaimed as she burst through the door. "There's an emergency!"

As she pushed into the infirmary, the first thing Rianna observed was that it was unlike the one back at the Mystic Celestial Sect. First off, it was extremely clean and very quiet. Of course, once can't expect extreme cleanliness and tranquility in a Sect that specialises in fighting.

"Please," a girl called out lazily. "No ruckus in the clinic, it will disturb the patients."

Shay-Hade looked around confusedly and said, "There's no one else here."

"There could be," the girl who reprimanded them said. She then gestured towards an empty bed and added, "Place her here."

"But there aren't," Shay-Hade insisted.

"Would you eat where you shit?" The girl asked offhandedly while inspecting Kili, who was now laying on the bed.

"What? No!"

"Well, I'll clean the toilet really well. So well that you can practically see your face on the floor?" The girl doubled down.

"Still... It's- It's not the place to eat," Shay-Hade murmured.

"Even if the library is empty, you maintain silence. It is a matter of principle. You respect the ambience for the purpose the location is built for. The clinic is meant to help those unwell to recuperate. Even if it is empty, we need to respect the sanctity of the establishment," the girl lectured.

"It's a pretty bad one," Rianna cut in, gesturing at Kili's arm, which was now being removed form the splint. "How do you intend to treat it?"

The girl looked up and examined Rianna and Shay-Hade critically.

"Thank you for bringing Kili in. Your kindness and prompt response in this matter is appreciated," the girl said monotonously. "Please leave while I treat the patient."

"Hold on!" Rianna cut in. "We'd like to know how you're going to treat the girl."

"Why?" The girl snapped back annoyedly.

"Forgive me, but I have a hard time believing a girl as young as you is capable of treating injuries like Kili's effectively," Rianna challenged while crossing her arms.

At this point, Shay-Hade stepped between Rianna and Kili and said, "What my partner is trying to say-" he paused and glared at Rianna before turning back to the other girl, "-is that we feel responsible for the child's well-being. So we'd like to be here as she gets treated."

"That won't be necessary," the girl responded. Shay-Hade noticed the uneasiness and anxiousness in her words, as well as the hasty side-eye she was constantly giving the unconscious child on the bed. It was clear that the girl wanted them out of the room immediately, which made it all the more suspicious.

Rianna ignored the girl's urging and plopped down on a chair.

"I'd REALLY appreciate it if you could please leave," the girl repeated, with a worried look on her face.

"You're just making me more interested in waiting it out," Rianna mocked.

"I-"

Just then, the trio all heard faint, childing mumbling originating from the bed behind them. Looking over, they saw Killi squirming and regaining consciousness.

"Uhm..." Kili groaned. "Where- Oh! I'm at the clinic... Hey, Big Sis!" Kili greeted as she sat up on her bed. She then enthusiastically waved with her right hand. "Where's Dora?"

"Shit..." The girl murmured before looking towards Rianna, whose eyes were wide and trained intensely on the waving child.

Shay-Hade furrowed his brows and followed his partner's gaze, more specifically her pupils which oscillated along with the child's waving hand. It took him exactly five seconds to put the details together. And just as his brain finished that calculation, his mouth subconsciously rattled it out loud, "The arm! It should be broken... How?"

The other girl quickly got between Kili and them and said forcefully, "Please leave."

"That should be impossible," Rianna finally spoke up. "Her arm was clearly fractured. But it is completely fixed. There was no magic, no potion, or salve applied."

Rianna's eyes darted around erratically as her mind started to process the information, "It has to be her body, then. Her physique or bloodline... But she's just a child with barely a trace of cultivation inside her, so it must have activated prematurely..."

She then walked over to Kili and started to inspect the bone, "Completely fixed. And the recovery is seamless; its almost like there was no fracture to begin with!"

Her eyes locked on to the other girl and Rianna quickly covered the distance between them. With her face barely a centimetre away, she interrogated, "The child, is it her bloodline or physique?"

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," the girl stuttered while avoiding eye-contact.

"It's probably something big," Shay-Hade said. "You can't get it out of her."

"You're right," Rianna affirmed.

As Rianna turned to leave, the girl quickly blocked their paths and challenged. "Look, I think you guys are mistaken. Maybe-"

"I know what you are trying to do," Rianna interjected. "But please do not insult our intelligence."

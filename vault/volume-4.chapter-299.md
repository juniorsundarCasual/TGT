Since her advancement, and gaining her version of the Heavenly Eye, Marie had spent every waking hour (which, for the record, could span multiple days given the sparse sleep cycles of Mages) exploring her power. She wanted to know its quirks, weaknesses and limitations down to the minutae. This proved to be difficult because magic was, to some extent, open to interpretation.

What was fire? It was the result of combustion. That was the classical definition. However, there were also other ways to create fire. Oxidation of Magnesium results in a fire too. Regardless of the many ways through which fire can be made, they are all codified and repeatable. The meaning of fire and how to create it does not vary from person to person. But when magic is involved, that doesn't always remain true.

Since cultivation is drawn from insights of a mage, and insights are what the mage understands the world around them to be. For a man born in a cave strapped to a chair, forever cursed to observe the shadows dancing on the wall in front of him, will have his entire world view biased based on what he sees on that wall. A chicken to him will be the sound, the smell of the bird, but the sight of its shadow.

Sensory biases, conformational biases, misinterpretations, all of these fallacies can mar the accuracy of a mage's cultivation (with respect to the actual 'true' world as Mister Larks always says).

Marie wasn't sure if the quirks, weaknesses and limitations of her powers were a result of her own limited understanding of the topic or her inbuilt biases that may have contributed to the way her cultivation was formed. Unfortunately, the world did not check your work for you. Even if your insights and cultivations are faulty and biased, they can still result in a stable core. Since as long as the cultivator strongly believes and can justify those beliefs, their cultivation will react strongly.

Her powers worked. Marie was certain of that much after confirming the impact of her actions with her Master. However, there were certain gaps in between that she was unable to fill. Why did the model of the world mesh with the Heavenly Eye's mana? It made sense to Marie - in some instinctual way. But scientific rigour was lacking! Without a formalisation of her breakthrough, it could not be repeated. Her successor would have to muck about just like her. Furthermore, they wouldn't be able to improve on her method, either meaning that any progress made would remain stagnant. But then Marie remembered two key details from her education under her Master and Mister Larks.

"Fate is one of the most fundamental phenomenon in the world. It governs everything," her Master would say.

"Mathematics is the language of the universe!" Mister Larks once said.

"Kind of make sense that the two can correlate," Marie concluded. "The only way to describe something that is the most fundamental building blocks of the universe is to use a language that can define the breadth of that knowledge. Ancient Tongue may be forbidden, but Mathematics isn't."

Marie was certain that she had only scratched the surface of mathematics, and she just couldn't wait to learn more. Because the more maths she knew, the more she could understand about the Heavenly Eye.

For one, Marie realised that she could actually see into people's past with her powers, and it was infinitesimally easier, and far more accurate to do so as compared to looking into the future. This wasn't something her Master could do with his Heavenly Eye. Essentially, Marie had nigh omniscience within her grasps.

"This is voyeurism," her Master said with a scoff, clearly trying to hide his envy.

"I do not derive any pleasure from this," Marie clarified.

"Be that as it may," he shot back. "What you're doing is a gross intrusion of other's privacy!"

"As if you aren't doing it already," Marie mumbled. "Your mana domain envelops multiple cities, if I'm not mistaken. How many bedrooms have you intruded with your powers?"

"I don't derive any pleasure from seeing mortals copulating, if that is what you're implying," her Master whipped back.

"So admit it! You're just jealous that I can do something YOU can't," Marie jokingly mocked.

"It makes no sense... How can the Heavenly Eye show what has already happened?"

"That's because the Heavenly Eye by itself isn't enough," Marie surmised. "There was something missing all along!"

"No kidding... Who knew that taking a step further from knowing one's sums and times-tables could revitalise a primordial cultivation method?" Master evoked with impressed surprise. "Back to our earlier topic, though. I fear you may be growing addicted to the power."

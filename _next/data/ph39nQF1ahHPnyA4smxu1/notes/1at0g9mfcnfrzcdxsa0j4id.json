The girl's words still resonated everywhere - he could hear it. It was as if the air itself could not accept the words and was actively rejecting it. The air grew heavier with each passing second. The clouds grew darker, and the sunlight grew dimmer.</p>\n<p>\"You've just gone and done it, haven't you...\" Krish said with a bitter smile. \"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"This was the only way,\" Marie explained. Her gaze grew distant, as through she was ready to accept her demise. \"This was the only guaranteed way to ensure that Kano and Dora would return alive.\"</p>\n<p>\"You could have asked for them to be brought back her right now,\" Krish reminded. \"Your words stated that they would only remain safe until they could return.\"</p>\n<p>Marie chuckled self-depracatingly and said, \"I forgot the conjugations.\"</p>\n<p>Krish gently raised his hand and rubbed his Disciple's head. \"You stupid child. Didn't I tell you of the consequences of using the Ancient Tongue?\"</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Marie expressed forlornly. \"I'm sorry, but I don't regret my decision. If my death can keep them safe, then so be it. They were the reason why I even decided to become your Disciple.\"</p>\n<p>\"How selfish can you be?!\" Krish snapped back. He then let out a tired sigh and said, \"Did you really think I'd let you die like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"W-Wha-\"</p>\n<p>|Everything Marie Reva, my Disciple, said in the Ancient Tongue within the past ten minutes was spoken in its entirety by me, Krish Nara. Everyone who heard it, heard me say it. And the world itself recognises me as the speaker,| Krish said.</p>\n<p>\"M-Master, no-\"</p>\n<p>Krish waved his hands and Marie's voice went mute. She tried to scream, yell, vocalise something, but no sound escaped her mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Just be quiet for a minute and listen!\" Krish rasped. He then looked at his Disciple with a apologetic expression and said, \"I'm sorry, but I don't regret my decision.\"</p>\n<p>A rueful laugh escaped him before he added, \"I didn't take on a Disciple, just to lose her. They say the worst Masters are the ones that have to buy their Disciples.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's happening?\" Guy asked as he approached the Master-Disciple duo chatting emotionally amongst themselves. \"What spell did Elder Nara just cast? It was a lot longer than any spell I've ever heard.\"</p>\n<p>\"It wasn't him, it was me!\" Marie yelled. Her face warped with surprise as she suddenly realised that her voice had returned to her.</p>\n<p>\"What are you talking about? Clearly Elder Nara was the one who just cast that spell,\" the man reaffirmed with certainty. \"We all heard it.\"</p>\n<p>\"N-NO you don't understand!\"</p>\n<p>\"There's no point,\" Krish interjected his Disciple's panicking. \"OK, I can feel it coming now!\"</p>\n<p>Krish suddenly plummeted to the ground and started to breath heavily.</p>\n<p>\"Master, what's happening?!\" Marie exclaimed while cradling the elderly mage.</p>\n<p>\"No one is supposed to speak the Ancient Tongue, it's supposed to be an extinct - dead - language. Anyone who utters it now will face the same fate. Complete extinction. I am going to be completely removed from this world,\" Krish explained whle wheezing out in pain. \"My body... is disintigrating as we speak.\"</p>\n<p>\"W-Why don't you Ascend?\" Marie quickly suggested, clearly grasping at straws.</p>\n<p>\"Girl!\" Krish snapped while flicking his Discple's forehead. \"Did I not make myself... clear. No trace of me... can exist. Not even an Inheritance Artefact. I... will disappear...\"</p>\n<p>\"N-No...\" Marie expressed and her shoulders slumped in defeat, tears started to well up in her eyes and she shook her head repeatedly in defiance. \"This can't be happening.\"</p>\n<p>\"What did you expect would happen?\" Krish said. Suddenly, a lone tear rolled down his right cheek, \"Wow... Its been over a millenium since I last cried... its a weird sensation, I will admit... Oooo, ok its hurting now...\"</p>\n<p>Krish groaned loudly and tried to massage his chest, but he saw that his right hand had turned into dust and disintegrated completely. He could feel the rest of his body following very quickly from the inside.</p>\n<p>It is believed that when one faces their own impending demise, their perception of time becomes warped. They start to relive every significant moment from their past in vivid detail. For a man who has lived for over two millenia, it should have been an awfully long slideshow. But much to Krish's surprise (and slight chagrin). It was just three scenes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\"You and I are fated-\" said the old man with a proud smirk to the chiselled teen with the domineering thighs and long locks of dark-brown hair.</p>\n<p>\"Look here, old man,\" the boy responded. \"I am only into women. Try that pick-up line elsewhere.\"</p>\n<p>The boy received a swift strike to the back of his head. He turned his head to admonish the attacker, but was surprised to find that it was his eldest sister.</p>\n<p>\"Shut your trap for one moment and just listen, you little pipsqueak!\" She screeched. \"You have no idea who you're talking to!\"</p>\n<p>\"This creepy old man?\" the teen asked derisively while massaging his head.</p>\n<p>\"Have some respect!\" His sister repeated while slapping the back of his head once again. \"This right here is a Tesseract Transformation realm expert! He could turn us into dust with a snap of his fingers. And he's actually willing to take YOU on as a Disciple, so watch your mouth.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, right!\" The teen said with a sarcastic snort. But he was immediately stumped by the absolute seriousness with which his sister and the man looked back at him. \"You're joking.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd kill you if I didn't have another choice,\" the old man spoke up with a sinister smile on his face. His long and thin silver mustache danced dangerously atop his even thinner lips as he let out a icy chuckle.</p>\n<p>\"Okay...\" The teen vocalised while taking two steps back in caution. Midway through his second step, his sister reached forward and grabbed the back of his head.</p>\n<p>\"Just accept, you idiot!\" She then forced the boy to bow and spoke on his behalf, \"Krish Nara accepts Mage Tycho as his Master!\"</p>\n<p>\"Formalities matter in these processes,\" Mage Tycho said before turning and walking away. \"Follow me, and do keep up. We have very little time to lose.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sis?! What the heck did you just do?\" Krish exclaimed after extricating himself from his sister's grasp.</p>\n<p>\"Don't be an idiot, Krish,\" he sister responded with a forlorn smile, completely unlike her usual uptight frown. \"Do you want to spend your entire life in this totally random and rural village?\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn straight! OW! Stop hitting me!\"</p>\n<p>\"The world is bigger than you think. Not all of us get the opportunity to see it in our lifetime,\" his elder sister explained. \"Don't lose this shot, Krish. See the world, become a big deal, and make us all proud.\"</p>\n<p>\"As if!\" Krish snapped back. \"I'm not going to remember any of you guys once I become famous.\"</p>\n<p>After saying that, Krish made a hasty retreat just as a wooden shoe zoomed past his face.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>'Becoming a practitioner of the Heavenly Eye was never an option for me, it was the only path. It is ironic that the pathway to truly untether oneself from the strings of fate is one that is inescapable.'</p>\n<p>'Often times, I wonder if I really wanted to become a practitioner of the Heavenly Eye... With great power comes a lot of forbidden knowledge. Knowledge that I regret learning. Living an ignorant life was so much better.'</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\"Foolish boy!\" Krish's Master yelled while slapping him in the face. Even though Krish had reached the Core Formation realm, and such strikes shouldn't have hurt him anymore, he still felt the pain. \"How many times did I tell you that we shouldn't interfere in the matters of mortals. The tethers that bind you to this world are fleeting and inconsequential.\"</p>\n<p>\"But they are my family-\" Krish protested.</p>\n<p>\"WERE!\" His Master yelled while giving Krish another slap. \"The moment you become a weilder of the Heavenly Eye, you transcend humanity and become superior. Your family is just a fleeting string in the complex tapestry that is fate.\"</p>\n<p>\"I never understood why you never divine my family's future when we first started. You KNEW! From the very start, you KNEW what gruesome future awaited them and you did NOTHING!\" Krish accused with bloodshot eyes.</p>\n<p>\"So what?\" His Master responded nonchalantly. \"Beast hordes have killed humans for generations. It is normal.\"</p>\n<p>\"What use is being able to control fate if we can't use it when it is needed the most?\" Krish asked in defeat.</p>\n<p>\"You can use your power when it is truly necessary. Your parents will die, and so will your sisters. It is an eventuality. What you have done is simply delayed that inevitability. You can't stop the tides of time from taking their lives. So what will you do when they grow old?\" His Master snapped angrily. He then pointed at Krish's leg, which was once thick with muscle but now shrivelled like a dried log, and asked, \"Do you think it was worth the sacrifice?\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p>'It was worth it. Even with such awesome power, I always felt powerless - useless. My Master always emphasised that we had to wait for \"the right time\" - the most opportune moment. But I slowly realised that it was always a myth. There is never \"the right time\". There is always a better time, but the wait for that is neverending.'</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The slideshow through his life ended as swiftly as it came, and his vision was fully filled with his most cherished memory - his Disciple. A fulfilled smile stretched his face and filled it with a long lost youth.</p>\n<p>\"I would... have loved... to see... you... grow up... to be... a... revolutionary... weilder... of the... Heavenly Eye... For... the short... moment... you've been... my Disciple... you've... made me... so... proud...\" Krish said with great difficulty. Starting from his toes, his body started to disintegrate and turn into dust.</p>\n<p>\"Keep... my... bag... It will help... you... It... has all... the artefacts... from the previous... owners... of the Heavenly... Eye... It's... unfortunate... that I won't... be able to... join...-\"</p>\n<p>And before he could finish he last words, Krish's body turned completely into dust and disappeared.</p>\n<p>Marie remained static as she kneeled over where Krish's body was laying just a moment ago.</p>\n<p>\"W-What just happened?\" Guy inquired worriedly. \"He just... disappeared. What happened?!\"</p>\n<p>\"He's... gone,\" Marie croaked. \"Forever.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>Marie stood up, picked up the cloth bag Krish always carried with him and slumped it over her shoulder. Without uttering a single word, she turned and left.</p>\n<p>\"Marie-\" Guy reached forward, but Marie dodged the hand and hasted her pace using the movement technique her Master had taught her. \"Wait-\"</p>\n<p>\"Are we just going to overlook the fact that a Tesseract Transformation mage just up and disappeared?!\" Rianna finally yelled in exasperation. \"He didn't even Ascend! Where the hell is the Inheritance Artefact?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mage Maddi, please be respectful!\" Grace snapped. \"Marie has just lost her Master.\"</p>\n<p>Rianna coughed as Shay-Hade also jabbed her hard with his elbows. He gave her a stern glare before apologising to Grace. The other Sect Members continued to investigate the sudden disappearance of the two children, while a single member split off from the group and followed Marie.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/q04871khcpm1lf70nkl7my6\">Chapter 407 - Reeling</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/8uct65roo2vtc1hcog5dbtr\">Chapter 405 - Manufacturing Fate</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

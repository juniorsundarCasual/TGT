His attention then alternated between the rectangular slab and the expectant woman holding a chisel confidently.</p>\n<p>\"Go on, then,\" Kam urged while patting Kano on his shoulder. \"Explain everything, leave out no detail. The more descriptive and personal it is, the better.\"</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of silence, Kam finally realised Kano's confusion.</p>\n<p>\"We're basically building your identity right now. In order to do so, you need a history. We are establishing that for you right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you going to chisel it into stone?\" Kano probed. It was at that instant that Kam understood the culture shock. Just earlier Kano had talked about books and knowledge transfer through written means.</p>\n<p>Kam gave off a wry smile and said, \"Dodi here is a trained Empath. As you evoke your history, she will seamlessly place herself in your boots and experience the scenarios herself. She will feel the same things you do and sense hte same things you do, as long as your description is clear and in-depth. She will then use this shared experience to etch your story into the identification tablet right there.\"</p>\n<p>\"An Empath?\" Kano asked curiously.</p>\n<p>\"Any skilled Enchanter can instill their experiences and stories into their work. That is the crux of enchanting, after all. But not every Enchanter can live in the boots of another and instill their experiences to stone, metal, or what have you. The one thing they cannot do, is speak on someoneelse's behalf. After all, an experience cannot be shared if you aren't present to experience it yourself. For an Empath, though, this isn't the case,\" Kam explained. \"An Empath is a skill gained through a Special Physique. You respond strongly to some emotions, even if you aren't the one who has lived through it. It isn't particularly a rare physique, as one in every one-thousand dwarf is found to have that ability. But is a well sought after position in the government. Everyone you see that works as a Clerk is an Empath. You can say being one guarantees you a rather cushy and stable job.\"</p>\n<p>At that moment, Dodi reached over the counter and swatted the back of Kam's head. \"You make it sound like I just lucked into this job.\"</p>\n<p>She then turned to Kano and added, \"Highly attuned empathy is both a blessing and a curse. It is a wild ability that triggers while you're listening to someone talk about their day. I once cried myself to near death after listening to my great-granduncle talk about his struggles during the Great War and the trauma that still lingered. They train you to be more targeted with your empathy here. Its an arduous course that pushes you to a mental breakpoint - they break you compeltely before you are remade into the stone-like entity you see before you today.\"</p>\n<p>She cleared her throat and said, \"Now then, let us get back to business. As Kam, said, keep your explanations descriptive. The more descriptive they are the easier it will be for me.\"</p>\n<p>Kano nodded thoughtfully and started and asked, \"Where should I begin?\"</p>\n<p>\"You can start as far as you can remember or from the time you came to the Fel Realm. I leave the depth of your history up to you. Though I must warn you to not flourish you accounts with untrue events. If you don't wish to reveal details from your past, I would suggest that you skip them. As an Empath, I can catch mistruths and lies very easily. However, I must warn you that if there are dependencies in the story that you reveal with the parts that you skip, then it will mess everything up as well. All-in-all, think clearly before you speak and be truthful,\" Dodi warned.</p>\n<p>\"The earliest memory I have is of hunger,\" Kano explained. \"Let me tell a little about myself. I am Kano Reva, and I am an orphan. I am also one of two, that is, I have a twin sister. She is probably somewhere, I hope that she's safe and finds people to protect her like Kam did with me. My sister and I were orphaned as babies. I don't know why or how. My adopted mother did not share a lot of details about our pasts beyond the fact that she found us in our cradles in a broken down carriage in the middle of a forest. She said that the sight was eerie, there were no signs of an attack, human, animal or otherwise. I don't know if I was abandoned, or if my parents were killed in some struggle. Regardless, Matron Reva likes to say that we were a gift for her. The world could not place us in her belly so it placed us in her path instead.\"</p>\n<p>As Kano narrated, something magical happened before him. The moment Dodi's chisel hit the tablet, an ethereal copy of the stone burst out and grew out before her. On this ethereal, purple projection, Kano saw Dodi's chisel marks taking shape. Surprisingly these marks did not show on the tablet. Kano stared in awe at the display filling up his visual space.</p>\n<p>\"The identification tablet is magically crafted with multiple layers of thin stone merged together with magican reagents. I cannot tell you the exact process, not because I don't want to but because it is far too complicated for you to understand. Basically, Dodi is etching into one of the layers that comprise this tablet. The magic lets her do that, and because of that you cannot see the immediate effect of her etching on the topmost layer-\"</p>\n<p>\"Stop distracting the boy and let him speak!\" Dodi barked while still concentrating on her task.</p>\n<p>\"As I said before, my earliest memories have been of hunger. Matron Reva carried a heavy burden of supporting a large family all on her own. But even under it, she never gave up. She didn't quit. She tried her best, and we could see that, which was enough. It was enough to know that we were wanted and loved by someone. But love and support can't fill in an empty stomach. And hunger can make you do... a lot of things that people would consider wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Kano looked at Kam with a distressed and embarrassed expression.</p>\n<p>\"Boy, you...\" Kam said with a faint choke in his voice.</p>\n<p>\"We never told Matron Reva this, but sometimes Dora - my sister - and I would go to the river bank and eat some clay. It was horrible, but it filled our stomach for a while. Our stomachs would be upset for many days after, but for the moment, the hunger pains would disappear and that was enough.\"</p>\n<p>Kano paused, looking far away like he was seeing something only he could. \"Once, me and Dora were by the river, and a man with a wagon stopped to let his horses drink. He didn't watch his stuff much. We were really, really hungry. And on his cart, there were these flour cakes. They weren't big, but to us, they were like a huge treat.\"</p>\n<p>He took a deep breath, his face showing he didn't like remembering this. \"Those flour cakes felt like the clay we ate before as the loamy balls fell into our hands. But they were different. The clay was just... cold and bland. It just made our bellies stop growling for a bit. But the flour cakes, they were warm and delightful. The cakes broke apart in our hands, just like the clay did. But the clay made our hands all dry and icky, and the flour cakes, they left our hands feeling warm and fragrant. They coated our tongues the same way clay did, but the aftertaste wasn't unpleasant - it was sweet. It wasn't just about not being hungry; it was like actually enjoying eating.\"</p>\n<p>Kano's voice got shaky. \"I knew we were doing something bad by taking them, but we were just so hungry. When you're that hungry, you don't think about right or wrong the same way. Afterwards though, the guilt returned and boy was it painful - even more painful than hunger, it turns out. The cakes that were in our stomachs caused a stomach-ache worse than clay! I hated myself for giving in to that instinct. But I also didn't regret it. It was a very confusing state - to be guilty about something, yet realising that you would do it all over again if given a second chance.\"</p>\n<p>Kano paused to let the emotion bubbling from inside dissipate. There were a lot of memories from his past that he wished to never relive, though that wasn't to say that his childhood was bad. There were many uplifting times that sufficiently quelled the pain from all the bad memories - more so during the recent years after Mister Larks arrived at their orphanage. Suddenly, Kano heard a faint whimper coming from up front. He looked up and noticed Dodi crying with tears streaming down her face, snot tumbling out her nose, and the ethereal projection quivering unstably.</p>\n<p>The projection disappeared altogether as Dodi collapsed onto her desk with a loud bellow.</p>\n<p>\"D-Dodi?\" Kam said while approaching his bawling cousin.</p>\n<p>Dodi suddenly snapped out of her explosive display of emotion and quickly dabbed her face with a kerchief from her coat pocket.</p>\n<p>\"How did you do that?\" She asked after cleaning her nose. \"Its been two decades since I empathised so strongly.\"</p>\n<p>\"W-What do you mean?\" Kano asked.</p>\n<p>\"Kid, I've had to empathise with people who've suffered worse than you yet I never broke down like this. I empathised for a child who'd been paralised completely and lost his parents all in one day because of a mine explosion (don't ask the details). I didn't cry then. But this... What did you do?\" Dodi's expression was half-intrigued and half-fearful which was another confusing mix of emotion.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" Kano said while scratching his head.</p>\n<p>Dodi hummed in thought before getting up from her seat and walking over to her neighbour.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Gruul!\" She yelled out to the man next to her. \"I need you to build the identification for this one. I need to recalibrate myself.\"</p>\n<p>The man looked much older than Kam, and had a long yet well-tamed beard and mustache, as well as a flowing lock of dark brown hair. His expression was at a neutral, unbothered state and his gaze was blank. He grunted before waving at Kano to approach him. This man observed Kano for a full minute before letting out a tired sigh and said, \"Continue.\"</p>\n<p>\"O-Okay...\" Kano muttered before starting all over.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">volume-6.chapter-416 (Private)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/phanbup6c7spa9rk8eb6ptc\">Chapter 414 - An Experiential Culture</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

However, on the artistic stage, a duel held a completely different essence. On this stage, the goal was for the competitors to triumph over each other through their artistic skills alone - having superior strength held no meaning here.</p>\n<p>Yet, one must know that losing the duel based on art often ended with the loser's entire career ending in jeopardy. That is, a budding artist would lose all credibility even before their career had a chance to take off while an established one would have their entire lives overturned in a single day. This is because the artists place the thing most valuable on the line when taking on the challenge: their reputation. Unlike with martial duels, where the loser either died or became disabled, a losing artist was wholly intact but had to live in a state of disgraced limbo. Their life would reach such a low point that they would wish they had just died that day.</p>\n<p>The duel between artists has, and always will be, a sacred rite without room for negotiation. Unlike physical duels, this one must occur in a public setting with multiple artists - without conflicts of interest with the competitors - present and willing to judge to ensure the sanctity of the outcome.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, because of the rigidity of this process, as well as the severe ramifications of suffering a defeat, an artist's duel was a rare occurrence. This was why everyone present in the Artists' Guild appeared so emotionally charged and excited for what may only occur once in their lifetimes.</p>\n<p>\"Who the heck is Jo Way?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's a 1-star Teacher from Radiant Academy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm... I can't recollect this person... Anyways, why is he duelling against Artist Norris, who is a 3-star Artist? Is he also a 3-star Artist?\"</p>\n<p>\"HA! No, he's not even licensed to practise!\"</p>\n<p>\"Such guts?!\"</p>\n<p>\"I know right! This guy is asking for trouble, I tell ya! Asking to have his face dragged through the mud. Humph!\"</p>\n<p>\"Did he challenge Artist Norris?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, it was the other way around?\"</p>\n<p>\"Umm, isn't Artist Norris just bullying the weak like this?\"</p>\n<p>\"You don't know the full story! It all makes sense if you hear it...\"</p>\n<p>And then, the crowd member expounded on the events that led up to this incredulous competition between two individuals who were, on paper, at two different skill levels.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Artist Norris was hired as a tutor for the second son of the Lionel Clan's Third Young Master. The boy was considered an artistic prodigy and the clan had to jump through a tonne of hoops to score this opportunity. On the day of the exhibition, Artist Norris was accompanying the boy around the hall, exposing him to the paintings when Teacher Way came around and openly criticised Arist Norris' opinions. No one could pinpoint for sure what events led to this happening. Different variations placed either of the parties in a better light. Ultimately, one thing led to another, and Artist Norris who had publicly lost face urged Teacher Way to compete against him in a duel, which the Teacher readily agreed to.</p>\n<p>However, after that, it appeared as though the Teacher didn't even know what an artist's duel was. In fact, he didn't even seem to know much about the nuances of painting and the techniques involved when someone asked him offhandedly.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Tsk</em> Young people are so arrogant,\" Keegan commented. \"Where is that man, Teacher Way?\"</p>\n<p>The crowd member who had provided the earlier exposition volunteered, \"He excused himself to the guild's library. Needed some inspiration, he said.\"</p>\n<p>\"You said that he didn't even have a practitioner's license? What farce is this?!\" Keegan blurted out. \"Let's go back!\"</p>\n<p>Right as Keegan said those words, someone in the crowd exclaimed, \"That's Artist Keegan Lang!\"</p>\n<p>\"The 6-star artist? What's he doing here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Idiot! Don't you know that his latest work is hanging in the exhibition?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is? Why isn't it the main event?\"</p>\n<p>Keegan coughed to interrupt the line of questioning. He didn't want to relive that embarrassment again. Yet now that his attendance was made public, a person from the centre of the crowd walked forward and greeted him with a respectful bow, \"Artist Lang. It is an honour to meet you.\"</p>\n<p>The man was Artist Norris, one of the participants of the duel. Keegan lightly nodded his head in acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>\"I humbly request that you act as one of the judges for this duel,\" Artist Norris continued.</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>Stumped, Artist Norris lowered his head further. He realised that he had let his hubris get the better of him, going as far as to make such a presumptuous request from a 6-star artist no less! That was three whole stars above him - what was he thinking?</p>\n<p>\"I-I-I-\"</p>\n<p>Keegan clicked his tongue and mocked, \"Yeah, I figured. You didn't even think, did you? Impulsive!\"</p>\n<p>\"W-W-What is going on?\" A meek voice vibrated from behind Keegan.</p>\n<p>\"That's Artist Norris, the person who is involved in the duel. He's asking Artist Lang to act as a mediator,\" Goran explained.</p>\n<p>\"Why are they competing through their painting?\" Kano asked while scratching his head in confusion. For him, drawing was a fun activity - something to be enjoyed. But the way things were being conducted before him, felt a bit stifling.</p>\n<p>\"One must be ready to stand their ground by virtue of their skills as an artist,\" Keegan answered while shaking his head. \"What would you do if someone less experienced than you, less learned than you, were to come forward and make libellous claims about your work?\"</p>\n<p>\"What should I do?\" Kano inquired with a blank expression. His eyes alternated between Goran and Keegan as though he were hoping to receive their opinions on the matter. This behaviour pleased Keegan as it indicated that Kano had acknowledged his skill and respected him.</p>\n<p>\"You must prove them wrong, of course!\"</p>\n<p>\"Ahh...\" Kano vocalised in understanding and nodded his head like a chicken pecking at grains. When they first met, Kano maintained caution when talking with or approaching Keegan. However, after walking around together and having a few intermittent exchanges, Kano had opened up a little and assumed his usual emotive persona. As Keegan gazed at the little boy with chubby, dimpled cheeks wearing a serious expression, he realised that the kid was kind of cute.</p>\n<p>\"But Artist Lang, why don't you want to help mediate the duel for Artist Norris? Isn't he doing e-e-exactly what you said someone should do in his place?\" Kano added with an innocent, curious gaze.</p>\n<p>\"I have better things to do, boy!\"</p>\n<p>\"You do? But weren't we just observing paintings? We can do that later too, right?\" Kano blurted out subconsciously. His face then drooped in disappointment.</p>\n<p>\"I kind of wanted to see how the duel would go...\" Kano sighed audibly and added, \"It sounded interesting...\"</p>\n<p>The corner of Keegan's lips twitched slightly. Honestly, he wasn't really interested in the duel at all. To him, the conflict between artists below him was akin to a petty, phallus measuring competition. However, it was also true that he had nothing else to do for the time being. He was initially here to contend against the interloper who stole his spotlight, but now he was only remaining because he was vaguely interested in the boy. Keegan very much wanted to drag the kid back to his painting and hear his opinions, but Keegan also recognised that in doing so he would only sadden and distract him. Keegan hoped that the boy would drop the request so that he could save some face, but it didn't appear as though that was going to happen anytime soon. There was no malice or scheming in the boy's gaze, just raw curiosity, so Keegan didn't have a valid reason to stick to his earlier point.</p>\n<p>\"Fine, we can stay and watch,\" Keegan acquiesced with a sigh, and then declared to the crowd, \"I won't be acting as a judge. Find someone else for that!\"</p>\n<p>Artist Norris silently receded, rejoicing internally that his impulsive faux pas didn't end up damaging him.</p>\n<p>\"Where is the other one, anyway?\" Keegan grunted with irritation. He had been waiting for a little less than half an hour now, and he was growing increasingly agitated by the fact that the supposedly heated duel had entered a standstill even before it began.</p>\n<p>\"Did he run away?\" Someone commented.</p>\n<p>\"No. Someone from the guild is monitoring him. He's still in the library,\" another person answered.</p>\n<p>\"What's he doing in there? It looks to me like he's just wasting our time!\" The first person complained.</p>\n<p>Right then, the figure they were waiting for strolled with a nonchalant stride and his hands shoved deep into his jacket pockets.</p>\n<p>Kano had heard of Teacher Jo Way before. He knew that his elder brother had lost to this person's student, so by default Kano had a poor opinion of the man. After observing him in person for the first time, Kano's dislike for the man was vastly exacerbated.</p>\n<p>It is often stated that when one meets another person for the first time, they must aim to bring forward their best self. This is because people's opinion of you is primarily dependent on their first impressions. If you come across as amiable, they will feel more motivated to socialise with you. If instead, you come forth like a cold recluse, they will subconsciously distance themselves from you.</p>\n<p>Kano's first impression of Jo Way was less than optimal. The man's gait was oozing with a kind of confidence that lacked substance. His face held a composure overflowing with toxic arrogance - the kind of arrogance that comes with being a prideful ignorant man. As Kano read the man's expressions, he observed that the man appeared unaffected and prepared for an unquestionable victory.</p>\n<p>\"Hmph! I thought you'd run away,\" Artist Norris taunted.</p>\n<p>\"What reason do I have to do that? I was the one who accepted your challenge, why would I run away?\" Jo Way retorted. He then continued by demanding, \"So, as the challenger, what conditions do you propose for the duel?\"</p>\n<p>Artist Norris sneered before listing the format for the duel.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/0zX7mtjmLRCO60UfhNgsh\">Chapter 129 - Artist's Duel (Part Two)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/1I1O0wpPOH5JfVGTjpLMH\">Chapter 127 - Warming Up</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

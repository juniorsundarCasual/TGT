The trio were on the outskirts of the woods near the Sect, in a relatively safe and open area.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I think we have to reduce the frequency of our weekly game sessions,\" Kano pointed out. \"Not a lot of people tend to show up at the start of the week.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh, you know what they say, if you work hard, you've got to play just as hard,\" Dora cut in while jabbing Kano with her elbow.\nd\n\"So what's the game today?\" Kili asked while excitedly rubbing her palms together. \"Cops and Robbers? Freeze-Tag? Hide-and-Seek?\"</p>\n<p>\"\"Hide-and-Seek,\"\" Kano and Dora said in unison. Kili gave the twins a weird look, to which Dora clarified with a wry smile, \"Ever since you started working out with Miss Maddi, you've gotten crazy fast. If you're \"It\" there's no way any of us stand a chance, so...\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh man!\" Kili groaned. \"I promise I'll tone it down.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's no fun either,\" Kano denied. \"For you, that is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, okay...\" Kili mumbled with a low mumble. \"So, who goes first?\"</p>\n<p>\"Majority wins!\" Dora declared as she placed her hand at the centre of the huddle. Kano and Kili joined in with their hands.</p>\n<p>\"~Majority~Wins!~\" Dora said in a sing-song voice, at the end of which everyone raised their hand and brought it down either face up or face down. Kano and Kili had theirs face down while Dora's was face-up.</p>\n<p>\"I'm it!\" Dora yelled before turning and running up to the nearest tree.</p>\n<p>\"1... 2... 3... 4...,\" she counted at a steady pace, allowing her friends to run around and find a place to hide themselves. Kano found a pile of leaves and hid himself inside. Kili, on the other hand, found a tall tree and scampered up it at an unbelievable speed, hiding herself amidst the branches.</p>\n<p>\"49... 50! Ready or not, here I come!\" Dora warned out loud. She then scanned the area around her for a few seconds before revealing a sly smile. She looked atop the tree she was counting at and asked.</p>\n<p>\"Did you see where they went?\"</p>\n<p>And from the tree, came a series of chirps in earnest.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, good sir! I will make sure to add more sunflower seeds in your bowl from tomorrow onwards,\" Dora responded while giving a salute. The branches rustled before a hefty sparrow flew away. Its wings struggled to keep its bloated form afloat, but it managed nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Dora floundered around a little before beelining straight towards the pile of leaves Kano was hiding under.</p>\n<p>\"Found you!\" She yelled as she leapt into the leaf pile. A few seconds later, she wrestled her twin out and held him in a necklock.</p>\n<p>\"Let... Me... GO!\" Kano said while fighting back his sister's vice grip. The grapple lasted for a few seconds and then Dora released him while giggling uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>\"You cheated!\" Kano accused. \"You barely took any time to find me.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not my fault that you're a lousy hider!\" Dora defended. She then harrumphed and started to walk in another direction, towards the tall tree that was also Kili's hiding spot. She bent down and started to sniff around and randomly inspect the soil in the surrounding area. After a few perfunctory gestures, she looked up and yelled, \"Found you! Come down.\"</p>\n<p>Almost immediately, Kili slid down the tree with an enraged look on her face.</p>\n<p>\"I saw what you did! You cheated! You talked to that fat bird Durkas keeps feeding!\" Kili accused.</p>\n<p>\"I knew it!\" Kano chimed in. \"You couldn't have found us so quickly without outside help.\"</p>\n<p>Dora let out a scandalous gasp and said, \"I did no such thing!\"</p>\n<p>Kili and Kano simultaneously dogpiled on Dora, the former held her upper body in a leglock while the latter started to tickle his sister continuously.</p>\n<p>\"S-STOP!\" Dora yelled between uncontrolled laughter. \"S-STOP IT!\"</p>\n<p>But the attackers didn't relent, they were furious after being bamboozled by Dora. While Dora struggled to find her breath amidst the tickling assault, her ears perked up and caught a faint noise coming over from inside the forest.</p>\n<p>\"G-Guys, ~Hehehehehehe~ Guys! ~HEHEHEHEHEH~ GUYS LISTEN!\" She yelled, causing the two attackers to freeze.</p>\n<p>\"W-What's wrong, Dora? Did we hurt you?\" Kili probed worriedly. She struggled to control her strength ever since her recent power creep.</p>\n<p>\"Did you hear that?\" Dora asked again while squinting and pointing her ears in the general direction of the sound only she could hear. Both Kili and Kano confirmed this fact by exchanging confused glances.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Dora's focused expression warped into joy as she immediately leapt into action and rushed into the woods.</p>\n<p>\"\"Dora, wait up!\"\" The others yelled as they also followed the girl. \"It's dangerous, slow down!\" Kano called out while panting. To his side, though, Kili had already covered the distance between her and Dora with two leaps.</p>\n<p>They ran through the woods with familiarity, as these parts were frequently walked by the Sect's members and were relatively safe. In fact, Kano quickly recognised their trajectory after a few seconds. His conclusions were affirmed when the area around dispersed into dust and revealed a vast meadow with a large, hollow tree at its centre.</p>\n<p>\"Fancy!\" Dora called out while beelining towards the tree. \"Fancy, I'm here!\"</p>\n<p>The trio waited with bated breaths for a response to resonate from within. And after five excruciating minutes, a whirring noise crawled out while growing in intensity over time. The volume reached a deafening level before four antennae poked out, followed by a scary, pincered head. Then came the sleek thorax and abdomen followed by a magnificient plumed wing of vibrant colours.</p>\n<p>\"Did you get smaller?\" Dora questioned, to which the creature nodded. In fact, Fancy had shrunk to half her size following her fusion with the Vespid Monarch. Her body had grown more condensed and curvaceous, closer to her original butterfly-like form.</p>\n<p>Fancy hovered above the tree and moved her antennae in a rhythmic pattern. Suddenly, a much louder whirring noise started to resonate from inside the tree. From all of its orifice burst out a wonderful, almost-living rainbow of coloured... things. It was a swarm, but not of creatures that were alive, but rather film-like, patterned fragments. The fragment refracted and diffracted the sunlight causing a symphony of colours to paint the world in a bright menagerie of colours.</p>\n<p>Kano's eyes sparkled as the colours started to turn into a beautiful narrative in his mind. His fingers moved naturally as he painted in the air and tried to envision the beauty of the scene on an imaginary canvas. But after a point, even he admitted defeat.</p>\n<p>Kili reached forward and caught one of the fragments, but the moment they entered her grasp they just burst into tiny, grain-like pollen.</p>\n<p>Fancy carefully guided the fragments towards Dora's back, where they started to arrange and condense themselves into a very colourful backpack. The process did not make any physical sense. Fancy then landed atop this backpack and carefully entered it. Although she was much larger than the bag, her body started to shrink and warp as it fit seamlessly into the much tinier space. A more knowledgeable mage would have immediately recognised this behaviour as rudimentary space manipulation.</p>\n<p>\"YES! I've caught a wild Fancy!\" Dora yelled. \"GO, Fancy! I choose YOU!\"</p>\n<p>Dora extended her hand and struck a pose as she envisioned Fancy making a dramatic entrance. Her eyes then crossed that of Kili, who was oozing a faint aura of bloodlust.</p>\n<p>\"It seems our gazes have met,\" Kili mocked. \"I challenge you to a battle!\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah?!\" Dora responded with a sneer. \"You and what army?\"</p>\n<p>Kili looked around and then assertively placed her hands on her hips and pushed out her chest. \"I will be Fancy's opponent.\"</p>\n<p>\"G-Guys, I don't think that's a good idea,\" Kano spoke up, but he was summarily ignored as Dora mimicked fixing her imaginary cap before moving into a throwing stance. She then fake-tossed a ball while yelling, \"GO! Fancy!\"</p>\n<p>As she did this, the creature that shrunk into her bag sprung out like a genie exiting a lamp and landed between her and Kili with a flourish of her wings.</p>\n<p>Kili didn't waste a second and burst into action. With a hard leap, she covered the distance between her and Fancy. Her arm was reeled back, ready to strike the creature. But Fancy zipped up and gained altitude.</p>\n<p>\"No, fair!\" Kili complained. \"She can't fly!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's part of her type, you can't ask her to not take advantage of it,\" Dora reasoned righteously.</p>\n<p>Kili growled in annoyance before compressing her legs and leaping up. Fancy did not expect the little girl to gain such altitude and found her lower two legs captured. She then flew around erratically to shake off the hanger-on. Seconds turned into minutes and Kili did not let go. Fancy grew more agitated and started to bob and weave in odd patterns while changing her trajectory suddenly.</p>\n<p>Then, finally, Kili's arm slipped. But unfortunately, she was far too high and Fancy had made a very sharp turn. This caused Kili to fly far away and out of the illusory zone that hid the meadow away.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Kili massaged her aching forehead as she inspected the shattered trunk of the tree that cushioned her fall. \"I've indeed gotten stronger,\" she commented with a satisfied smile.</p>\n<p>CRACK!</p>\n<p>A loud tearing noise caught her attention. She looked up and noticed a very visible tear in what could only be called the fabric of reality marring the clear blue sky. Through the crack, she saw a type of darkness she had never imagined in her entire life. Not even the bleakest of nights could describe the utter, pitch-black void gazing beyond.</p>\n<p>Like lightning, the crack broke off from the sky and descended towards the ground. Stupefied, Kili could not gape as her gaze followed the indescribable phenomenon disappearing into the illusory zone.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, no...\" Kili mumbled before running back. The moment she entered the meadow, she was greeted with a scene of utter carnage. The land itself was torn apart, ripped out forcefully from the ground. The beautiful field was demolished unnaturally - the world itself had carved out randomly sized chunks out of it.</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, the malformed tree remained intact on an island unaffected by the disaster.</p>\n<p>\"Dora?\" Kili called out loudly. \"Kano? You there?\"</p>\n<p>Kili waited. But she could not hear a response. She started panicking. She did not know what had happened, but she knew that whatever it was, it was bad. Real bad.</p>\n<p>\"What happened?!\" A voice cut in. She turned around and was assuaged to see a small crowd in place, led by the Sect Leader.</p>\n<p>\"I... I-\" Kili started. \"Dora and Kano,\" she finally redirected. \"T-They're gone!\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/atbmajglkfq5x8us70djeog\">Chapter 403 - End of the World</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/uwrio68hcmz572rk46qlg4i\">Chapter 401 - Crumbling Reality</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

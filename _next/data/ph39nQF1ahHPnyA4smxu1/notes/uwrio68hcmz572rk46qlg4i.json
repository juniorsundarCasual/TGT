Minutes passed and no indication arrived from beyond the door. She then pulled her lips in bit down worriedly. She knocked again and warned, \"I'm coming in.\"</p>\n<p>Once inside, she noticed that Shuri was curled up in her bed. The breakfast brought in earlier in the morning remained by her bedside, untouched. A depressing aura hung over the girl, one which even bordered on suicidal tendencies. This, Jean was intimately familiar with. Jean's mana senses scoured the room for anything that could encourage the girl to take drastic measures. Her focus was on sharp objects, anything that could be used as a rope, and anything that could suffocate or choke.</p>\n<p>\"You have to eat,\" Jean said while maintaining her scan. \"How will you have the energy to do anything if you plan to starve yourself to death?\"</p>\n<p>\"What's the point,\" Shuri mumbled from under her blanket. \"I can't advance. If I can't advance, I will remain stuck like... this. Heck, I can't even use magic without my entire body convulsing in pain.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about all the progress you've made till now? Are you prepared to just give it all up?\" Jean probed.</p>\n<p>\"Again! What's the damn point?!\" Shuri yelled while pushing aside the blanket weighing her down. The two exchanged gazes for a while before Shuri cut it off and returned to her impromptu blanket shell.</p>\n<p>\"Please, leave me alone.\"</p>\n<p>Jean reached forward to assuage Shuri but stopped midway. There was nothing she could do or say that would get the girl out of her depressed state.</p>\n<p>\"I'll get going, then,\" Jean said before getting up to leave.</p>\n<p>'I guess what Sect Leader Larks said is my only option,' Jean thought to herself while closing the room door. Although it didn't sit right with her, it looked like that was the only way to move forward.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\"Get up!\" Marie snapped. \"Eat!\"</p>\n<p>\"Why are you here? I told you to leave!\" Shuri yelled back. \"Just let me be, please!\"</p>\n<p>\"No can do,\" Marie denied while placing the plate full of food in her hand on Shuri's lap. \"You either eat this, or I will call in Matron Reva.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that a threat?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it was pretty clear that it was a threat,\" Marie responded with a faint smirk.</p>\n<p>Shuri looked at the food on her lap for a while. \"I don't feel like eating.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then don't eat to feel, eat to live.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm a Foundation Establishment realm mage, I can go for days without food or water,\" Shuri reasoned while placing the plate to the side.</p>\n<p>\"But the energy to sustain those foodless days will be drawn from your mana core, which you absolutely can't let happen unless you wish to suffer excruciating pain,\" Marie rebutted.</p>\n<p>\"So what?\" Shuri declared. \"Why does it even matter? Let it all just end!\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't let that happen,\" Marie said calmly. \"I am the one who saved you from certain death.\"</p>\n<p>Shuri looked at Marie with disbelief in her gaze and confusion scrunching up her face.</p>\n<p>\"What are you-\" At that moment, her eyes widened in realisation. \"The bandits! I-It was you! I should be defiled and dead!\"</p>\n<p>Marie nodded slowly to emphasise her point.</p>\n<p>\"But why? How? We didn't even know each other?\" Shuri jabbed with a pained rasp.</p>\n<p>\"I needed someone- the Sect needed someone of your calibre and character,\" Marie explained. \"I didn't want to railroad the life of someone who had their whole future open to them. You, on the other hand, had no future. So I felt, that maybe, this would be a fitting second chance for you.\"</p>\n<p>There was silence for a long minute before Shuri's tight shoulder crumpled and she started to laugh uproariously. However, Marie could feel derision and irony oozing out of it rather than sincere elation.</p>\n<p>\"Even now, I am a pawn in someone else's game. There is no escape for me, is there? I'm either the instrument of someone's revenge or the tool for an organisation's prosperity. There is no future where I get to do what I want, where I get to be what I want. Even the powers that be, if they even exist, chose to place me in a body that doesn't feel like my own.\"</p>\n<p>Shuri's laugh subsided and she continued in a calmer tone, \"I feel like an imposter no matter where I am or what I do.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shuri-\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd like you to leave now,\" Shuri demanded before curling back into her blanket.</p>\n<p>Marie gazed at Shuri's back for a while before reaching forward and pulling aside the blanket forcefully.</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing?!\" Shuri yelled.</p>\n<p>\"Ever since you joined the Sect we have offered you every opportunity to be true to yourself and be comfortable in living the way you want,\" Marie emphasised. \"I want you to honestly tell me that the life you've had here has been the same as it was for you back at the Palace!\"</p>\n<p>Without waiting for Shuri's response.</p>\n<p>\"We've made it clear every step of the way that we accept you the way you are - warts and all - as long as you can be honest, truthful and trusting. But you have been anything but that. I get it, your past has been traumatic and discourages you from trusting easily. But for the sake of all that is good in the world, can you for a moment get out of your head and look at what all you have around you?\"</p>\n<p>Marie pointed towards the door and said, \"At any point in time at least five people are roaming the hallways in case you need something or do something - you're a Foundation Establishment realm mage, you should have noticed that already. Did you know that Jean has been working on ways to help your body adapt to becoming a girl? Did you know that Markus has left the Sect for Radiant City in search of books and articles that talk about failed advancements into the Core Formation realm? Did you know that Matron Reva has been working night and day to make food for you that you enjoy eating - we've been eating Spiced Chicken Rice at the mess hall for three dinners straight now. Did you know that my Master and Sect Leader Larks have been doing their best to clear up any evidence or trail that will lead the Empire to find you?\"</p>\n<p>Marie paused and let out a long breath, \"What I'm trying to say, and want you to know, is that here you are surrounded by people who care for you and wish for only good things to happen to you. So instead of hiding away in this room, and shutting yourself off, come out and open yourself up to the warmth that is being sent your way. I know, it won't solve the struggle you are going through, but it will at least put things into perspective. You don't have to hide anymore. You can be what you want, even if the world isn't being cooperative. Look! You're even being allowed to live in the girls' dorms.\"</p>\n<p>As Shuri digested those words, Marie continued in a softer tone, \"I had an ulterior motive to saving you, I will admit that. But from that point onwards, I have never enforced my or the Sect's requirement on you. All I have done, or at least tried to do, is motivate you to open up and be who you want to be. If you honestly felt that I was railroading you and forcing you into a position that you hated being in, then I will apologise for that as well because it wasn't my intention.\"</p>\n<p>\"Besides,\" Marie said finally while standing up to leave. \"If it will make you feel any better, I am sexually attracted exclusively to females. And I still find you extremely attractive.\"</p>\n<p>\"Still?\" Shuri grasped with a faint smile. \"So when did it start?\"</p>\n<p>\"Umm...\" Marie mumbled as a faint red tinge tinted her cheeks.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Shuri said while Marie kept grasping at straws to come up with a response. \"It does make me feel better. It's comforting to know that even though I myself am struggling to come to terms with who I am supposed to be, others around me are already comfortable with it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not everyone,\" Marie pointed out. \"My Master is still struggling to understand the situation. But please don't be too harsh with him or take his words to heart. He is trying really hard though, I can see that, and you will too.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know...\" Shuri said with a descending volume. \"You... don't have to go. We can talk for a while longer... if that's okay.\"</p>\n<p>Marie closed the door and sat down beside Shuri, \"I will if you eat your food.\"</p>\n<p>Shuri snorted good-naturedly, placed the plate on her lap and started to scoop the rice with the wooden spoon. \"How much do you know of my past.\"</p>\n<p>\"I haven't scoured your history, just the most recent year before you ran away,\" Marie explained.</p>\n<p>\"Then you won't know the name my mother gave me, my supposed 'real' name,\" Shuri started. \"It's Shura, don't think so hard.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's very...\"</p>\n<p>\"Low effort? Yeah, I know,\" Shuri said with a chuckle. \"My mother wasn't the brightest firefly of the swarm. I struggle to make sense of how I became so intelligent. I suspect my father's DNA did most of the heavy lifting, but don't tell my mother that unless you want to be on the receiving end of the most childish fit an adult can throw - actually you'll have to explain what DNA is to her first.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I don't really blame her, you know,\" Shuri continued. \"That's a lie, I blame her a lot. But nowadays I've had the opportunity to think a lot about my past. And I've realised that she's only done the best she could with the cards she's been dealt, just like I have. Her whole life was taken from her, and in the span of a day, she was turned from the carefree Young Mistress of a rather powerful clan to a caged bird whose only purpose in life was to birth offspring for a man, like a broodmare. Compared to that, how easy has my life been?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't say that,\" Marie cut in while handing Shuri a cup of water. \"Everyone's life is difficult.\"</p>\n<p>\"Exactly!\" Shuri volleyed. \"Knowing that gave me perspective on my struggles. I don't have to like my mother, but I don't have to hate her. She never did anything hateful to needlessly ruin my life. If she hadn't disguised me from birth, I wouldn't have lived for this long. I wouldn't have survived the struggles of the Inner Court. I wouldn't have reached the True World Sect. I wouldn't have met you, Markus, Jean, Matron Reva, the Sect Leader, and all the other members. I wouldn't have learned to properly harness magic and Automagy and advanced so far in my cultivation. Heck, knowing all of that, struggling with an identity crisis doesn't seem so bad.\"</p>\n<p>The duo laughed together as they drowned away the sad atmosphere with a warm blanket.</p>\n<p>\"You couldn't have been completely alone in the Palace, right? You at least had that Eunuch,\" Marie pointed out.</p>\n<p>\"Eunuch Bang?!\" Shuri exclaimed. \"His true name was Yor. He... He was closer to a father to me than anyone else.\"</p>\n<p>The duo continued their lively conversation well into the night as the sun set and the moon illuminated the world in its splendid light. A stout woman walked away from the door to Shuri's room and towards the mess hall with a warm smile on her face, knowing that Shuri did not go to sleep today with an empty stomach.</p>\n<p>\"So I take it that she finally ate?\" Guy said as he saw Grace smile.</p>\n<p>\"She did,\" Grace answered with a weary smile. \"In depression, hunger is the first natural feeling that gets muffled by the body. One should never forget to eat or drink even if the world is crumbling around them. I learned that the hard way.\"</p>\n<p>Guy hugged Grace and said, \"It will all get better, trust me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do,\" Grace answered lightly while hugging him back.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/umd6rncdq0od2sz1i04l5b8\">Chapter 402 - Missing Children, Reward if Found</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/9s1t5atn6dpj7xcy0oo3jxg\">Chapter 400 - Ms. Understood</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

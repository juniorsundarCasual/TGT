Time had not been kind to this humble abode; ever since the Sect relocated to the mountain, this hut had been left to the mercy of neglect and dust. The memories, however, lingered stubbornly, as vivid as the day they were made.</p>\n<p>The air inside was stale, thick with dust motes dancing in the slivers of light piercing through the cracks. Marie made her way to her Master's old mattress, an island in a sea of forgotten times. She sat down, the familiar yet now foreign fabric beneath her offering little comfort. Her elbows found their way to her knees, and she buried her face in her hands, a dam holding back an ocean of sorrow.</p>\n<p>A muffled wail broke from her, her palms barely containing the torrent of grief. The tears came unbidden, each one a testament to her loss. Her siblings, though safe, were far from her, and her Master, her mentor, her guide, had paid the ultimate price for their protection.</p>\n<p>\"Why?!\" she cried out, her voice cracking under the weight of her anguish. \"Why, why, why... WHY?!\"</p>\n<p>In the midst of her despair, Marie felt a presence beside her, quiet yet unmistakable. Before she could lift her head, a gentle hand wrapped around her, drawing her close. She felt her head being guided onto a comforting shoulder, a familiar, reassuring touch amidst the chaos of her emotions.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay,\" Shuri's voice was a soft whisper, a soothing balm to Marie's frayed nerves. \"Let it all out.\"</p>\n<p>Marie's defenses crumbled at the kindness in Shuri's embrace. She allowed herself to be vulnerable, to grieve without restraint. Her cries filled the hut, each sob a release of the pain she had been carrying. Shuri held her, a steadfast presence in the storm of Marie's sorrow, offering silent support and understanding.</p>\n<p>As Marie's fit diminished, Shuri asked, \"Would you liked to talk about what happened?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's gone,\" Marie answered with a cracked voice. \"He'd disappeared. And it's all my fault.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" Shuri responded. \"Why do you think it is your fault?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because...\" Marie tried to come up with a response, an explanation of any kind, but her mind just didn't function. There were no thoughts left in her head anymore.</p>\n<p>\"I want to be alone for a little bit. Can you leave me here?\" Marie asked.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I can do that,\" Shuri responded. \"When I was going through something like this, you didn't let me wallow in my own thoughts all alone. Even if you don't want to talk to me, let me be there with you. You can ignore me, I'll just sit over there in that corner silently.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please-\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't argue over this,\" Shuri interjected while sucking in a sharp breath of air in protest. \"You carry on as you were. Cry if you must, yell or swear if that helps. But don't collapse on me. I know that you are stronger than that. Do you think Elder Nara would wish to see you in this state?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't!\" Marie snapped angrily.</p>\n<p>Shuri raised her hand apologetically, \"I guess its too soon. Well, I meant no offence.\"</p>\n<p>Shuri pulled over a seat for herself, the same one Marie's Master loved to sit cross-legged on, and sat over at the corner as she had promised. Marie looked at the girl pointedly, before shaking her head and leaving the hut.</p>\n<p>Marie chose to take a long walk, but was irked to notice that Shuri was still following her. Marie, in turn, activated her movement technique and built a hefty distance between herself and Shuri. But a few minutes later, she found the girl following her while breathing heavily. Since Shuri could no longer rely on her core to sustain herself, she was closer to a regular human. And so, exhaustion was something that couldn't be avoided.</p>\n<p>\"Why are you following me?!\" Marie voiced her annoyance.</p>\n<p>\"I... told you. I can't... leave you... alone... when you... need me the most,\" Shuri said while wheezing. \"Can... you slow down... please?!\"</p>\n<p>Marie clicked her tongue before sitting down by a nearby tree and resting her back against the trunk. \"Take five!\" She commanded Shuri, to which the girl smiled gratefully and plopped down on her back. Marie revealed a faint smile before it faded and turned into one filled with melancholy. She looked towards the clear blue skies and let herself dwell on a singular thought.</p>\n<p>Her Master was gone... forever... and it was all her fault...</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Wei Zao was suddenly thrust back into his body with the same apathy with which he was first displaced from it. A faint shudder rushed through his spine as the realisation of what was to come settled in.</p>\n<p>\"Come out this instance, you scoundrel!\" An angry voice bellowed from outside.</p>\n<p>\"Who the-\"</p>\n<p>\"Teacher Way!\" A worried voice called out to him as Gaige rushed into the room. \"T-They're here!\"</p>\n<p>\"Who?\" Wei Zao asked in confusion. He was still recovering from the disorientation of being removed and stuffed back inside his body.</p>\n<p>\"The Gierg Clan Leader...\" Gaige said with a bitter look on his face.</p>\n<p>\"Um... Who?\" Wei Zao repeated. As he said this, he saw Gaige's expression become increasingly contorted with anger.</p>\n<p>\"Jenna's clan!\" Gaige said while grinding his teeth. His look was distant but warped with rage. It was clear that the boy had some sort of grudge with them. 'But what was it...?'</p>\n<p>It was embarrassing, really. The issue wasn't that he had forgotten about the grudge, it was that there were just too many going on at once that it was all just melding into one.</p>\n<p>\"Was this the one with the broken engagement or the kid who screwed you over during the most recent Teacher's Expo?\" Wei Zao asked while massaging his forehead.</p>\n<p>\"The engagement...\" Gaige responded angrily.</p>\n<p>\"How do you want to handle this, then?\" Wei Zao asked back without much thought. \"I don't want this to stretch out for any longer than it already has. The whole damn clan has been a pain in my backside for the last year. This is going to keep on going until either I die or the whole clan does. And let's be honest here, it probably won't stop there. Because there is always a hidden expert somewhere who has ties with the clan who will take offence and bear down on me...\"</p>\n<p>Gaige's expression warped with confusion as Wei Zao rattled on and on without pause.</p>\n<p>\"As I was asking,\" Wei Zao said finally, \"How do you want to handle this?\"</p>\n<p>\"I... don't know...\" Gaige answered with honesty and utter bewilderment. This wasn't how his Teacher usually behaved - there was always a sense of certainty and decisiveness in his actions which had suddenly fizzled away.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I think we've already avenged the loss of face you were subjected to from having your engagement broken when we humiliated your ex-fiance,\" Wei Zao expressed. \"Do we need to go any further?\"</p>\n<p>\"I... don't think so,\" Gaige said after a moment of contemplation. \"I mean, this whole fight with the Gierg Clan has the possibility of drawing my clan into the mess as well. I don't think my father will appreciate the political trouble that could cause given the tumultuous state the Empire is in right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Exactly, the way I hear it, the Emperor's on a maddened warpath ever since that terrorist attack that has allegedly... emasculated him...\" Wei Zao said while swivelling in head around. He'd heard of gruesome deaths being granted to people who propagate the salacious rumour of the Emperor losing his manhood. Even though the Bori Clan's Capital Household had protections against observers and spies, one just couldn't be careful enough these days.</p>\n<p>\"So... what do we do?\" This time it was Gaige who proposed the question.</p>\n<p>\"To be honest, we have bigger fish to fry than upholding our reputation. The world is literally about to end very soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"What-\" Gaige started, but at that moment, the same voice that threatened and called out Wei Zao yelped with shock, \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!\"</p>\n<p>Gaige and Wei Zao exchanged a look before darting towards the window. They carefully followed the Gierg Clan Leader's upward gaze and noticed a massive black crack splitting the skies.</p>\n<p>\"Teacher Way...\" Gaige mumbled in a daze. \"W-What's happening?\"</p>\n<p>\"As I was saying,\" Wei Zao repeated with a steely tone. \"The world is about to end. These troubled about saving face and reputation are trivial matters. What you're seeing out there, that's just the start. I've witnessed what happens next and its not pretty. Very soon, another world will collide with this one, bringing with it terrors and monstrosities beyond your wildest imagination.\"</p>\n<p>Gaige swallowed an audible gulp of dry air, as all the saliva disappeared from his mouth. \"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd love to explain the details, but I'd rather not waste time here. We have to go,\" Wei Zao declared before moving away from the window and walking up to his enchanted leather back hanging by the door.</p>\n<p>\"Where are we going?\" Gaige blurted out while leaping up to his Teacher.</p>\n<p>\"You see, Gaige,\" Wei Zao started. \"I'm not originally from this world. I know, hard to believe. But just suspend your scepticism for a minute and just consider the possibility. I come from another world where reality is a lot different from this one. There isn't magic, at least not to the degree that you have going on here. In turn, technology has advanced so far that you would very easily confuse it for magic.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you saying-\"</p>\n<p>\"But you see, there is in fact another individual whose been brought in from another world, just like me,\" Wei Zao interrupted. \"Us two, we are the only ones who know what is going to happen eventually.\"</p>\n<p>Gaige looked at Wei Zao as though he was looking at a mad man. Wei Zao let out a tired sigh and held the teen by his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"I really don't have time to waste here. If you believe me, come along. Otherwise, I will have to go by myself. Don't worry though-\" Wei Zao reached into his bag and pulled out a handful of books, \"I've already compiled everything you will need to eventually reach Tesseract Transformation realm. I was going to give it to you incrementally. But if this is as far as you are willing to follow me, no hard feelings.\"</p>\n<p>With that said, Wei Zao placed the books in Gaige's hands and turned to leave. But almost instantly, the teen called out, \"Teacher, wait!\"</p>\n<p>The boy bounded forward and stood beside Wei Zao, \"I am not an ungrateful wretch. You've done so much for me, even if you asked me to jump into a pit filled with Manticores, I would do it without question!\"</p>\n<p>Wei Zao ruffled the boy's head and said, \"What you're about to do is far closer to that than you might think. So, thank you for believing in me!\"</p>\n<p>\"Anyways,\" the man said as he let out an embarrassed cough, \"Is there a backdoor or secret tunnel we can sneak out of?\"</p>\n<p>Gaige let out a light chuckle and said, \"Follow me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good lad!\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/q04871khcpm1lf70nkl7my6\">Chapter 407 - Reeling</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/1at0g9mfcnfrzcdxsa0j4id\">Chapter 406 - Actions and Consequences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/q04871khcpm1lf70nkl7my6\">Chapter 407 - Reeling</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

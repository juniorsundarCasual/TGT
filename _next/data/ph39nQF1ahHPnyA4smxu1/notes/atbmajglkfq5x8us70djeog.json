His mind went blank and his body went limp as everything started to shut down. It was overwhelming. For just a fraction of a second, Guy recognised the feeling. He'd felt it before, years back in fact.</p>\n<p>To confirm his suspicion, a voice that had been missing from his life for a while now resonated in his mind.</p>\n<p>(Guy,) Mast greeted, but Guy could not respond. The pain was far too much. (Let me help you with that.)</p>\n<p>And suddenly, like switching off a light, the pain just stopped. In fact, Guy couldn't feel anything anymore. He was no longer inside his body either. He felt himself getting shoved down a very narrow tube, with a heavy suction on the other end pulling him somewhere.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Guy was deposited in his favourite void - the place between worlds where he arrived between his transmigration and death. Now, though, he existed in this place as an ethereal copy of his current form, while Mast appeared as a basketball-sized, purple wisp floating by his side.</p>\n<p>\"Long time, no see,\" Guy said with a sarcastic drawl.</p>\n<p>(Has it?) Mast responded. (Time doesn't work the same way for my kind.)</p>\n<p>\"I hope that wasn't a joke,\" Guy snapped back.</p>\n<p>(We don't do that,) Mast waved off blankly.</p>\n<p>Guy averted his attention from the purple wisp and was surprised to notice a much larger, metallic blue wisp some distance away undulating erratically.</p>\n<p>\"What's that?\"</p>\n<p>(That's the being who created the world you are inhabiting right now,) Mast answered. (You can call him Tron.)</p>\n<p>\"Why's he much larger than you?\"</p>\n<p>(Size as a dimensionality is a relative construct for our kind,) Mast answered cryptically.</p>\n<p>\"Enough with this!\" Guy yelled in exasperation. \"What gives, Mast? You ghost me for months on end, and suddenly this! What the hell is even going on?!\"</p>\n<p>Mast's form quivered for a few cycles before he said, (Tron's first world has succumbed to the invader.)</p>\n<p>Guy's brows furrowed as he digested that information. \"I'm... sorry...\"</p>\n<p>(Why do you apologise? It wasn't you who caused it.)</p>\n<p>\"I know... but it has still got to hurt. I mean, it's almost like someone just destroyed a part of your lifeblood, right?\" Guy explained.</p>\n<p>(It's part of the natural ecosystem,) Mast responded. (Just like prey and predators coexist in the wild. Original and Parasitic world builders are also part of a similar cycle.)</p>\n<p>\"Why am I here?\" Guy asked.</p>\n<p>(You will know. But first, we must wait for the other participant,) Mast commented.</p>\n<p>\"You don't mean-\"</p>\n<p>\"What in the world was that?!\" A long-forgotten voice yelled as another ethereal form materialised in the void. It was a man whose appearance could be the visual definition of the word handsome. His chiselled face, toned yet lean body, voluminously flowing hair... Guy literally could fill multiple paragraphs describing the man's top-class looks.</p>\n<p>{Stop whining!} A pink wisp by the man's side hollered. Unlike Mast's usually detached tone, this one carried a clear tinge of annoyance.</p>\n<p>\"Stupid syst-\"</p>\n<p>{For the last time, I'm not a 'system'!} The wisp emphasised before floating away from the man.</p>\n<p>\"Who-\" The man pointed at Guy and tilted his head in ponderance. \"Have we met before? I feel like we've met before.\"</p>\n<p>\"We have,\" Guy accepted with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\"Why can't I remember your name?\" The man murmured. \"Wait-\"</p>\n<p>[The connection to my previous world is lost,] the large blue wisp expressed tiredly. [Oh, it seems that everyone is here already. Hello, Guy Larks and Wei Zao. I believe those are your designations.]</p>\n<p>\"Guy Larks?\" Wei Zao reiterated in confusion. \"Where have I heard that name before?\"</p>\n<p>[It was brought to my attention recently that my two associates here had smuggled in a soul from each of their worlds. Have they informed you of the reason for their actions?]</p>\n<p>Guy nodded, but Wei Zao simply said, \"Wasn't it just a gift of a second life?\"</p>\n<p>{I didn't explain to him,} the pink wisp spoke up. {This one's extremely annoying to talk to.}</p>\n<p>[On the contrary,] the blue wisp addressed Wei Zao directly. [They had another motive in bringing you two here. Though I don't compute the efficacy of that decision since two foreign souls are inconsequential in the grand tapestry of causality.]</p>\n<p>\"WAIT!\" Wei Zao interrupted. \"Y-You're the other guy! I knew there had to be another one. The Printing Press, and the influx of modern inventions flooding the market. It was you, wasn't it?!\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Guy answered evasively.</p>\n<p>\"Don't give me that bullshit! You-\"</p>\n<p>[I am a world builder,] the blue wisp continued, silencing Wei Zao in the process. [We are beings who literally build the worlds that souls inhabit and maintain them. The world you live in right now was built by me. The ones you came from are built by Mast and Moni respectively. While these two only manage one world each, I happen to manage two. However, my first world has been parasitised and wholly consumed by another world builder of the parasitic order.]</p>\n<p>\"What is all this?\" Wei Zao blurted out. \"Sys- I guess your name is Moni. What the heck is going on?\"</p>\n<p>{Just shut up for once and listen!} Moni chided.</p>\n<p>\"That's easy for you to say. I've literally been pulled into what feels like a plot way above my paygrade and I don't even understand a ninth of what is being said,\" Wei Zao complained.</p>\n<p>[I believe a visual display will be of assistance here,] Tron stated before the void gained dimensionality and stars started to dot the scene. The surroundings turned into the vast emptiness of space, serene yet suffocating.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, the scene started to warp and the dotted stars started to blur as though they were entering lightspeed.</p>\n<p>[The inhabitants of my previous world made it quite far in terms of understanding the rules I set in building it,] Tron's voice echoed all around them. [The races had all set for the stars, and were able to travel between planets nigh-instantaneously through warp travel.]</p>\n<p>Guy found himself hurled out of lightspeed and deposited before a chaotic scene.</p>\n<p>As Guy gazed into the vast cosmic expanse, a sense of impending doom gripped him with a vice-like intensity. The supermassive black hole, an ominous gateway to cosmic chaos, loomed threateningly, its gravitational pull distorting the very fabric of reality. The danger emanating from this celestial aberration was beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p>From the heart of this cosmic maelstrom emerged tentacles, grotesque appendages that defied the laws of reality. These were no ordinary tentacles; they were a kaleidoscope of menace. Slimy green tendrils slithered with an unsettling viscosity, leaving a trail of corrosive residue in their wake. Their touch could dissolve matter into an unrecognizable, gelatinous mass, a testament to the insidious threat they posed.</p>\n<p>Contrastingly, the red tentacles were adorned with thorns sharp enough to pierce the toughest cosmic armour. Each thorn dripped with a toxic venom, injecting a lethal concoction that brought immediate agony to anything it touched. The very sight of these crimson spikes hinted at the relentless, predatory nature of the cosmic horror unfolding before Guy's eyes.</p>\n<p>Veiny and pulsating, the pink tentacles seemed almost organic as if they were the arteries of some monstrous cosmic entity. They constricted planets with an unholy grip, draining the life force from their cores. The very essence of these celestial bodies was being siphoned away, leaving behind desolate landscapes and barren wastelands where vibrant ecosystems once thrived.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, the luminescent purple tentacles glowed with an eerie radiance, casting an otherworldly glow on the scenes of destruction. Their incandescent beauty belied their true nature â€“ conduits of devastating energy that could unleash cosmic forces capable of obliterating entire galaxies. The luminescence served as a haunting reminder that even amidst the celestial horror, there was a twisted allure that mesmerized onlookers while sealing their fate.</p>\n<p>As Guy's awareness expanded, he realized the magnitude of the cosmic crisis. Across every galaxy, a symphony of destruction played out, echoing the relentless battles fought on the besieged planets. It was a universe on the brink, teetering on the edge of annihilation as cosmic forces clashed in a desperate struggle for survival. The heavens themselves bore witness to a cosmic battlefield, a theatre of war where the forces of entropy clashed with the remnants of cosmic order.</p>\n<p>The world, or rather the entire cosmos, stood at the precipice of obliteration, and Guy was left to grapple with the enormity of the threat that now encompassed all of existence. The fabric of reality was unravelling, and the impending doom seemed inevitable, casting a shadow that stretched across the cosmic tapestry.</p>\n<p>[My world was invaded through these natural tears in spacetime that are commonplace in every world,] Tron explained. [Black holes, as they are called, are necessary puzzle pieces in every stable world. But they are also a source of vulnerability. The invaders used this vulnerability and planted a seed in them. Every vibrant soul that died in the vicinity of these tears was sucked into them instead of being routed through me. When enough souls accumulated in the tears, they then formed sentient amalgam entities. Over time, four entities became most prominent and managed to extend their influence outside the tear in spacetime through the same way you managed to enter my new world, possession. They enticed native creatures of my world to lower their guard and take control. Little by little they invaded society and wreaked havoc. The worst part is that any entity killed by a spawn or possession from the tear in spacetime gets routed back into the tear and to the invader.]</p>\n<p>\"What about this world?\" Guy asked.</p>\n<p>[I have taken precautions. The spacetime tears of this world are more... reinforced. In fact, most supermassive tears are inhabited by a creature of the void of my own design,] Tron explained.</p>\n<p>\"That's guided creation, right? I thought world builders were all about nudging development in a positive direction, and not about taking full control of it?\" Guy probed.</p>\n<p>[It took a lot of effort from my side to make it happen. But I deemed it necessary. I don't want a repeat of my previous world, of course,] Tron answered matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>\"These creatures of the void,\" Wei Zao cut in. \"What do they look like?\"</p>\n<p>[They look like madness,] Tron answered curtly.</p>\n<p>\"What does madness look like?\" Wei Zao continued.</p>\n<p>[Madness looks like madness,] Tron reiterated.</p>\n<p>\"It feels like you aren't understanding the question-\"</p>\n<p>{Just shut up and listen!} Moni reprimanded.</p>\n<p>[What you are observing in this visual is the world getting sucked dry of all vibrance,] Tron stated, and the scene started to fast-forward. The desolation that played out was a nightmarish symphony of entropy, a relentless march towards the annihilation of vibrancy and life itself.</p>\n<p>The world, once vibrant and teeming with vitality, was now a desolate wasteland. The fast-forwarded scenes depicted planets being ruthlessly drained of their life force, a cosmic vampirism that left nothing but arid landscapes and barren expanses. The very essence of existence was being mercilessly sucked dry, leaving behind a haunting tableau of cosmic decay.</p>\n<p>The tentacles, once mere extensions of the cosmic horror, now grew with an insatiable hunger. They reached outwards, extending their suffocating grip across the celestial canvas, their tendrils growing thicker and more pervasive. What started as a localized threat had metamorphosed into a cosmic plague, engulfing entire galaxies in an ever-expanding abyss of despair.</p>\n<p>As the planets were desiccated, the once-thriving ecosystems collapsed into nothingness. Creatures, unable to withstand the relentless drain on their life force, succumbed to the inexorable pull of the tentacles. The scenes were a harrowing testament to the unyielding cruelty of the cosmic forces at play.</p>\n<p>The influx of nonsensical entities continued unabated. Green, red, pink, and purple beings of pure chaos proliferated, their very existence defying logic and reason. The absurdity of their forms mirrored the chaos that had gripped the cosmos. These entities, devoid of purpose or meaning, populated the desolate realms, further exacerbating the surreal nightmare that unfolded.</p>\n<p>As the fast-forwarded narrative progressed, the once-lively galaxies became mere shadows of their former selves. The cosmic tapestry, once painted with the hues of vibrant nebulae and swirling stardust, was now tainted by the encroaching darkness of the insatiable tentacles. The visual tableau was a manifestation of cosmic entropy, a relentless march towards the void where all meaning and vibrancy ceased to exist.</p>\n<p>Tron's declaration hung heavily in the air, resonating with the gravity of the unfolding cosmic tragedy. The world, once a bastion of life and vibrance, was now a desiccated husk, consumed by an unfathomable force that cared not for the beauty it obliterated. The relentless progression of the scene echoed the inevitability of cosmic decay, a dire fate from which there seemed to be no escape.</p>\n<p>[At this point, the entire world is the parasite's,] Tron stated. [Since they don't have a world of their own to sustain them, they will bleed this world for all that it is worth and then move on. And because my second world is searchable by tracking down my signature, it is only an eventuality for my new world to be on the parasite's crosshairs].</p>\n<p>[In fact, there is nothing that can stop the invader from finding and attacking my world. I can build protections and countermeasures, but seeing how effectively he dismantled my first struggle, it is clear that the attacker is far more experienced and stronger than I am. This world is going to succumb too-]</p>\n<p>(And when it does, mine and Moni's world will soon follow. We borrowed a lot from Tron when building our worlds. Because of that, there is a route that exists that leads right to our worlds.)</p>\n<p>{And we aren't so experienced so as to put up a fight against the attacker, like Tron. If the parasite hits us, we will give up immediately,} Moni interjected. {The fate of this world and your original worlds hangs in the balance.}</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/q08v7xlng9pz9mogijd6251\">Chapter 404 - Two Worlds Collide (From the Inside)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/umd6rncdq0od2sz1i04l5b8\">Chapter 402 - Missing Children, Reward if Found</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

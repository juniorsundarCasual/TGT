He didn't even bother asking the important questions such as: </p>\n<p>How did I die?</p>\n<p>Why am I here?</p>\n<p>Instead, he just went with it.  It was a second chance for him after all. His dead-end job as a librarian wasn’t taking him anywhere.</p>\n<p>The world he was brought into was one filled with magic. There existed something known as mana in the environment, that people known as mages could use to do extraordinary things. </p>\n<p>It was all very daunting. But the deity that brought him to this world offered to give him a system. Something that could support him in this world.</p>\n<p>Since he spent most of his past life in the library as part of his job, the first thought that came into his mind was to have a library that could give him the answer to anything.</p>\n<p>For the diety, this wasn’t a hard task to accomplish. And thus started his adventure in this new world, with his Omniscient Library System.\n“Jo! Wait for me! I have some more things I want to discuss!”</p>\n<p>A sweet voice echoed from behind him</p>\n<p>Wei Zao hurried his steps to add distance between himself and the woman chasing him.</p>\n<p>‘Damn it! Why is this woman trying to find trouble with me?’</p>\n<p>But no matter how hard he tried, Wei Zao just couldn’t outrun a mage just on the cusp of breaking into Foundation Establishment.</p>\n<p>“Jo, why don’t we continue our discussion over lunch,” Mai declared matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>Wei Zao’s eyes twitched when he heard her tone of voice.</p>\n<p>‘It’s like she’s doing me a favour.’ But of course, he didn’t voice that thought out loud.</p>\n<p>“No thanks. I have better things to do,” Wei Zao replied and turned to leave.</p>\n<p>Mai stood in place, stumped. For someone who was used to getting her way most of the time, this was her first rejection, and that too from someone that she considered beneath her.</p>\n<p>She snorted in derision, ‘He probably got lucky and remembered the contents of that book. I’ll get you another time.’</p>\n<p>But Wei Zao had already erased that whole interaction from his mind. His main goal in visiting the library was to accumulate more technical knowledge from this world to find a solution for his student’s problem. Although he asked the deity to provide him with a system that could answer all of his information, it seemed that it was incomplete.</p>\n<p>‘System why aren’t all the book already inside the Omniscient Library? Should omniscient mean to know everything?’ Wei Zao asked in an annoyed tone.</p>\n<p>{To have everything from the get-go can become overwhelming. It is safer for your sanity if only the pertinent information is available at the required time.}</p>\n<p>Wei Zao sighed. ‘But why do I have to scan through the entire book before getting it inside the library? Why can’t I get it copied by just touching the book?’</p>\n<p>{There is a saying to never judge a book by its cover. It is possible for the contents of the book to be completely different from what is written on the cover.}</p>\n<p>‘Stupid system, you’re just making my life harder aren’t you?’ Wei Zao chided.</p>\n<p>{…}</p>\n<p>An interesting feature Wei Zao discovered in his library was its ability to correct any errors in texts. For instance, Wei Zao knew of the typo in the book Mai brought up way before he even reached the afterword because the library highlighted the text and provided a correction for it.</p>\n<p>‘In that sense, I guess you are omniscient. Fake news is dangerous after all.’</p>\n<p>Wei Zao’s first student, Gaige Bori had a latent draconic bloodline. In this world, humans can have special physiques or bloodlines depending on the make-up of their lineage.</p>\n<p>Humans are one of the most vanilla species in this world. A base human does not have any inherent advantages. Compared to other humanoid species such as elves with their high affinity to natural mana, and dwarves with their naturally high strength, a human is as basic as it gets.</p>\n<p>However, when a human mixes with another species, the offspring is guaranteed to be human but with a special boost which is the special physique or bloodline of the other species.</p>\n<p>That begs the question, how does it all work? Naturally, procreation should be impossible across different species! And that fact remains true as long as the human and the other species haven’t yet reached the Core Formation realm.</p>\n<p>Once a mage, regardless of species, breaks through Foundation Establishment into Core Formation, they are no longer considered as a member of their base species. For elves and dwarves, this is when they branch out into different sub-species. </p>\n<p>For elves, depending on their cultivation method and alignment, they either become high elves, dark elves, wood elves, mers, or fae. As for dwarves who live in isolated clans, they advance into the inner circle of their respective clans such as the Ashfire dwarves, or the Bluesteel dwarves.</p>\n<p>As for beasts that have reached Core Formation, they gain the ability to adopt a new form based on their cultivation method and alignment. Many chose to adopt a humanoid form, others choose to push deeper with their current form.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, once they reach this stage, mages can copulate cross-species. Which opens up the world to a more varied genetic make-up. It is analogous to jumping from nucleated ponds to one large ocean.</p>\n<p>In the case of Gaige, it just so happened that his mother had an extremely pure draconic bloodline. His father, during his travels, once met a beautiful woman out in the woods. Her raven black hair, deep blue eyes, and slender and seductive figure completely enamoured him. After spending a few years with her, one day she just left. His father searched far and wide, but never found her again.</p>\n<p>10 years later, a baby was dropped off in front of the Bori household with a letter. It was from the woman Gaige’s father met. The letter affirmed that the child was his, but Gaige’s father was sceptical. That was until he looked into the babies eyes and saw the same deep blue void that belonged to that woman. He knew right then and there, without a shadow of a doubt that the baby was his.</p>\n<p>He took the baby in and raised it diligently with his other children. Since Gaige was from another woman, his presence was always a scar in his current mother’s heart. She thought that Gaige’s father strayed and had relations outside of the marriage. No matter how much his father tried to clarify that he didn’t, Gaige’s current mother just didn’t believe him.</p>\n<p>What his parents failed to realise was that Gaige’s birth mother was a Core Condensation stage Abyssal Wyrm in human form. Wyrms have naturally long gestation periods, it was only 10 years because the other half was human, otherwise, she would have carried the child for half a century. His father had an inkling that the other woman was of a different base species. But which one, that detail forever remained a mystery.</p>\n<p>This also meant that the potency of the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline in Gaige’s body was extremely high, he just didn't know it.</p>\n<p>While this signified that Gaige had a limitless future, when it is inert at the early stages of cultivation, the Abyssal Wyrm’s bloodline is highly volatile </p>\n<p>Nearly all bloodlines and physiques naturally activate once the mage breaches into Foundation Establishment. It is at that realm when their inherent advantages start to become visible. It is also unsafe for a Mana Condensation mage to activate their bloodlines or physiques as it can cause adverse effects on the unprepared body such as abrupt mutation, rapid cellular regeneration resulting in tumorous growths, and even death.</p>\n<p>So for Gaige, his problems were two-fold. First, his current cultivation method was the Bori clan’s ‘Bright-Fire Path’. It was naturally attuned to the light and fire elements, which weren’t compatible with his bloodline. Second, the inert Abyssal Wyrm bloodline would randomly wreak havoc as he tried to advance his realm methodically.</p>\n<p>After going through the academy’s library, Wei Zao had developed a two-pronged solution. First, he had to develop a cultivation method aligned with darkness. And second, he had to devise a strategy to either suppress the Abyssal Wyrm bloodline or activate it safely, so that Gaige could advance in his cultivation.</p>\n<p>Getting a darkness aligned cultivation method was easy. After collecting a series of dark-type cultivation methods, the Omniscient Library collated a fitting style that closely matched Gaige’s bloodline and could support him till Foundation Establishment. To go further, Wei Zao would need to collect more Advanced methods for his library.</p>\n<p>For the next step, Wei Zao decided to use special potions that would facilitate partial bloodline activation. For those, he needed rare ingredients that weren’t readily available in the academy. </p>\n<p>And that’s why he was now standing outside the Alchemy Guild’s Building.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/oLYNqzxvE1HnsB0d48eRt\">Chapter 009 - Wei Zao the Serial Page Flipper</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/6NvLfyedVItSP2eUM1zQ1\">Chapter 007 - Kerfuffle in the Library</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

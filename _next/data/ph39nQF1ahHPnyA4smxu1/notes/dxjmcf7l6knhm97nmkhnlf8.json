Your purpose... Spreading the truth of the world and unravelling the lies that keep the uninformed masses in check? Something like that?\" Guy mocked. \"Let me tell you, your so-called 'purpose'... it is not going to go the way you think.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ha!\" the Other Guy scoffed. \"And do enlighten me, why would that be?\"</p>\n<p>\"You are the kind of guy who burns bridges,\" Guy highlighted. \"For you, people fall under one of two categories: those that are with you (and align with your views) and those that are against you (or who disagree with your views). Do you think everyone will just automatically follow your every word? Sure you can force them with the voice, but is that really what you want at the end of the day? A bunch of puppets miming your every word mindlessly?\"</p>\n<p>Guy did not receive a response, this meant that the Other Guy was at least receptive to Guy's words.</p>\n<p>\"If you want to make changes you not only need to start from the bottom, but you also need to create receptivity at the top. Otherwise, the water that boils up will never find an outlet to escape. To do that, you need to negotiate and collaborate with people. Do you think you can manage that?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can be 'convincing' if I want to,\" the Other Guy growled.</p>\n<p>\"And that is your problem. Telling someone to do it and making them willing to do it are two different things. Which do you think is superior?\"</p>\n<p>Again, no response.</p>\n<p>\"Furthermore, I admit that you are a far better orator than I am. You can work a crowd more dynamically and with greater immersion. But you lack the expertise to teach. What do you intend to do with all the kids joining the Sect? Do you plan on leaving them to their own devices after throwing away some motivational lines? How would that be any different from every other sect we've seen so far?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am already setting the stage for you to realise your ultimate goal. The quickest way into the hearts of people is through material goods, which is what the Verum Trading Company seeks to do,\" Guy highlighted. \"Take a moment to consider me and my capabilities objectively. You were right when you said that we share a lot of similarities in our core and that our competencies and personalities deviate greatly. But that isn't a bad thing. What you lack, I have in spaded and vice versa. We complete each other, don't you see?\"</p>\n<p>\"ENOUGH!\" The Other Guy declared forcefully before a tense silence escaped through the tear.</p>\n<p>The Other Guy hummed and then said with a chuckle, \"It sounds like you just want me to do your dirty work. You want an excuse, and I'm the most convenient one.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't lie,\" Guy admitted. \"I am lacking in many crucial ways that pertain to our survival. You can fill in those gaps. But that does not mean you are without any shortcomings. There is no shame in accepting them.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you want, then?\" the Other Guy shot back exasperatedly.</p>\n<p>\"Well, my first thought was to work towards a merging-\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't wish to lose myself in you,\" the Other Guy denied decisively.</p>\n<p>\"Don't think of it that way. Think of it as gaining something,\" Guy assuaged.</p>\n<p>\"Package it however you want, but the end result won't be me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I figured that you would say that,\" Guy said with a sigh. \"Which is why I present you with an alternative. It will be a bit more difficult.\"</p>\n<p>\"A system that satisfies both parties,\" Guy proposed. \"Rules, conditions, and so on.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the void peering through the tear shuffled to reveal an eye.</p>\n<p>\"Go on.\"</p>\n<p>\"We will establish conditions for relinquishment of the 'light' so that control of the body can be switched between us. It also enforces conditions for when big decisions need to be made so that both parties are involved rather than just one,\" Guy continued.</p>\n<p>\"Since there are two of us, one must be the primary,\" the Other Guy pointed out.</p>\n<p>\"I will be the primary.\"</p>\n<p>\"WHAT?!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hear me out-\"</p>\n<p>\"Save your sophistry. I was wrong to underestimate your nature. Under that bumbling facade, you hide a venomous snake!\" The Other Guy accused.</p>\n<p>\"It's not like that,\" Guy tried to cut in.</p>\n<p>\"I will take what is rightfully mine-\"</p>\n<p>\"You want to talk about right?!\" Guy cut into his counterpart's emotionally charged tirade. \"I was the one thrust into this body once its previous owner relinquished it, not you. You were just a byproduct of an experiment gone wrong. What you are is a parasite, a worm piggy-backing off of the work of others. I'll say it once, and I will say it again, you will NEVER be able to achieve anything by yourself. Every step you take, while decisive, lacks wisdom or future sight. You don't know how to take two steps back to take three steps forward. And worst of all, you are selfish-\"</p>\n<p>\"Take that back!\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? Too hard to digest?\" Guy goaded. He was growing frustrated with the childish immaturity of the man beyond the crack. \"Do you know what sacrifice or compromise even means? To give away something valuable for the benefit of another, willingly? When the chips are down, do you think you can do it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Enough!\"</p>\n<p>\"You preached with such gusto about how you 'avenged' the children hurt by the Beggars' Sect. But did you stop to think how your unapologetic culling of an entire organisation would affect the Capital's ecosystem as a whole?\"</p>\n<p>\"They were weeds! Their existence was a malaise to society.\"</p>\n<p>\"Even weed has a purpose in an ecosystem. This ill society has been functioning for years. By removing a monolith, you have paved the way for smaller factions to fill in the gaps. This will lead to more conflicts and deaths. A hammer is not a multipurpose tool - if you strike a screw, all you will do is damage the surface. While I agree with your assessment of the Beggars' Sect, if you had conferred your actions with me, we could have gone down a more reasonable path with less bloodshed and collateral damage,\" Guy expounded.</p>\n<p>\"You don't seem to have an off button, is what I'm trying to say,\" Guy summarised. \"Bulldozing through everything isn't a catch-all solution. Furthermore, we have more responsibilities. The kids, for instance.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know how to manage my flock,\" the Other Guy grumbled.</p>\n<p>\"Your \"flock\" are still youth going through their most crucial stage of development. How much experience do you have working with people their age?\" Guy challenged. \"I, for one, actually have a resume loaded with verifiable work experience in this particular field.\"</p>\n<p>\"So, in the grand scheme of things, you taking control of my body as the primary is more detrimental to your cause, do you not agree?\" Guy followed up immediately.</p>\n<p>\"Huh? What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you not agree?!\" Guy repeated.</p>\n<p>\"Do I not agree? Or do I not, not agree? Double negatives... so yes?\" The Other Guy had unwittingly fallen into a classic verbal trap through a targetted barrage of facts and logic ending with a convoluted mess of a question.</p>\n<p>Guy metaphorically dabbed the metaphorical sweat cascading down his metaphorical face (after all, he couldn't sweat while inside the RoK). The war was nearing its conclusion and victory was almost at hand. He had corralled the Other Guy with unassailable logic and even turned his opponent's emotionally charged and opinionated words against him. Admittedly, this was Guy's greatest debate yet and had the greatest odds (as his identity and life literally hung in the balance).</p>\n<p>It was the final sprint, and the finish line was approaching quickly! But right as his chest hit the silk ribbon of completion, he was violently pulled out of his meditative state.</p>\n<p>\"Father! Father! Help!\"</p>\n<p>Guy's sight turned clearer, and the first thing he saw was Dora's panicked face drenched in tears, sweat and dirt.</p>\n<p>\"Dora-\"</p>\n<p>\"Father, help! Middle Sister Jean, she-\"</p>\n<p>Dora gasped for air.</p>\n<p>\"Middle Sister Jean is in trouble! She needs help!\"</p>\n<p>\"W-What happened? Where is she?\" Guy gushed out as he leapt onto his feet.</p>\n<p>'Due Northwest,' the Other Guy responded with a solemn voice, echoing inside Guy's mind.</p>\n<p>'How do you know?' Guy responded as he leapt through the window and landed on the ground with a heavy thud.</p>\n<p>'A shepherd who loses his sheep isn't meant to be a shepherd,' the Other Guy scoffed without losing his stern demeanour.</p>\n<p>Inside the Church, the Other Guy extended his hand and grasped the flickering string that extended out of Jean's ethereal figure.</p>\n<p>\"She is undergoing deep emotional distress. I can only do so much to keep her from falling apart,\" he mumbled with his eyes closed. He then gently massaged the string, causing the flickering rate to stabilise.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/ixrqv93p3op4dt3e8quknsy\">Chapter 289 - Intercepted</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/n3tp44jugsh4vumpk6nc0ql\">Chapter 287 - Bargaining for Control (Part One)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

After all, she wasn't one to make impulsive decisions. And it was during this contemplation that Marie realised her true drive in wanting to learn magic. Why was she so enamoured with learning how to predict the future like great master Nara? It was to preserve what she had and what she held so dearly and close to her heart: her family.</p>\n<p>However, finding her resolution was one thing, presenting this in front of Teacher Larks was another. Marie recognised that it would be selfish and utterly disrespectful of her to put forth the request of entering great master Nara's discipleship as well as indulging in Teacher Larks' enlightening lessons. For one thing, Teacher Larks was providing her with the benefits completely free of cost - at least great master Nara attached a stringent requirement to his offer. This in and of itself greatly troubled Marie and gnawed away at her until she finally entered a perturbed sleep.</p>\n<p>Marie woke up with a heavy heart early in the morning; she was fully prepared to sacrifice her interest in favour of what she considered her responsibility. Yet she decided that it would be unfortunate if she left without trying. The only reason Marie even bothered to bring up the idea in front of Teacher Larks was that over the past few weeks of interacting with the man, she understood his personality perfectly. She knew that Teacher Larks didn't hold any expectations with her. He taught her because he enjoyed teaching. He indulged Markus and Jean, as well as the other kids from the village because he liked interacting with them. And he offered his services for free because he had no great ambitions. Still, the reason why such a brilliant man, with a mind filled with ideas and thoughts well beyond his generation, had decided to slum it out in such a backwater village was beyond Marie's understanding.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Marie was confident that Teacher Larks wouldn't take offence in her impertinence, and she was right. But what she didn't expect was that Teacher Larks accepted her proposal and even went as far as to probe great master Nara to test his credibility as her prospective Master. An unusual feeling welled up from within Marie as she followed the stable figure leading her down the steps to the village.</p>\n<p>It was the feeling that she seemingly yearned for, but didn't know about until she experienced it herself for the very first time. Was it security? Dependence? The feeling of having someone to rely on?</p>\n<p>Although she'd lived with Matron Reva for a long time now, Marie never felt this way before. It wasn't that Matron Reva wasn't dependable. Rather, Marie could feel that Matron Reva had her burdens to carry, and it wouldn't be proper to dump her's on top of all of that. But then why did she feel more secure and comfortable in unburdening herself with Teacher Larks? Was it because he was a man? Unlikely. Because if so, she would feel equally dependent on Markus even if the boy was younger than her. Then was it because he was a mage? Maybe. Strength did offer some solace.</p>\n<p>Yet Marie felt it was most likely because Teacher Larks did not look like someone with the weight of life bearing down on them. He just looked so carefree, and in control. Yes. That was what Marie yearned for! Control...</p>\n<p>'Teacher Larks cares for me!' Marie's supposed cynical facade completely shattered as a feeling of warmth wrapped all around her, finally showering her with a sense of reassurance that she desperately yearned for.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe he isn't so bad after all,\" she muttered to herself in an inaudible voice.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(And that's five,) Mast's voice echoed in Guy's mind.</p>\n<p>\"Huh?\" Guy paused. \"Who?\"</p>\n<p>(The girl,) Mast hinted.</p>\n<p>Guy chuckled internally with excitement upon hitting the milestone towards unlocking the remaining portion of the RoK. He anticipated the addition of Marie towards the count, however, after trying time and time again and failing, he was close to giving up on getting through to the girl.</p>\n<p>'So stubborn,' Guy commented internally. The girl had insane trust issues that troubled Guy to no end. She did open up recently. For instance, as they were descending the steps, she went as far as to explain her findings of the soothsayer named Krish Nara and his powers, as well as her interest and goal with entering his discipleship.</p>\n<p>All that aside, now that the RoK had tagged five students, Guy was even more elated as he could access the more advanced books from high-school level and above.</p>\n<p>'You could have just left everything open from the start, you know. What was the point of placing the barriers anyways?' Guy said.</p>\n<p>(Motivation,) Mast added. (I found that most humans tend to work harder if they are provided with clear objectives and targets. Otherwise, they revert to laziness and sloth.)</p>\n<p>'Motivation to do what? I thought this was just a second shot for me? I thought I was free to do whatever I wanted?'</p>\n<p>(Sure,) Mast replied curtly.</p>\n<p>Guy wanted to continue the discussion, and possibly explore the new books available to him as well, but he didn't have the time to do so just yet. Because right then, the group had arrived at the base of the steps. They turned to the left and, following a short minute, they arrived in front of great master Nara's cottage. Just as Teacher Larks reached forward to knock on the door, it swung open gently and a calm voice echoed through, \"You can come in. The door's open.\"</p>\n<p>Guy walked in and greeted Krish with a warm smile, followed by his students.</p>\n<p>Krish lowered his head lightly in acceptance and beckoned for the group to take a seat. Although Guy had been in Krish's cottage before, he was still impressed by his minimalist lifestyle. There weren't many items of furniture or material possessions decorating the desolate household. The last time he was here, there was only a rattan bed frame with a thin mattress - that still looked barely used - and a single wooden chair. Today, surprisingly, there were three more chairs placed conspicuously in front of the bed, where Krish was seated with crossed legs.</p>\n<p>\"You were expecting us?\" Guy probed.</p>\n<p>\"I was shown that it would be today,\" Krish replied.</p>\n<p>\"So you must already know why I'm here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I do. But I'd like to hear it from you,\" Krish beamed back.</p>\n<p>\"Marie here has informed me that you are willing to accept her as your Disciple if she is interested in learning your cultivation art,\" Guy started.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The girl is fated to The Heavenly Eye. There is no escaping it,\" Krish interjected.</p>\n<p>\"Then as her guardian by proxy, it is my duty to ensure that she is in safe hands,\" Guy pointed out with a firm tone.</p>\n<p>Krish chuckled ominously and said, \"It's not like you can stop it from happening. The girl's mind is set-\"</p>\n<p>\"No, it's not!\" Marie interrupted. \"I-If Teacher Larks denies it, then I won't become your disciple.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't lie to me, girl. If it were so easy to change your mind, you wouldn't have gone around asking others in the village about me,\" Krish replied with a sly grin.</p>\n<p>He then snickered in seeing the girl's mouth bursting agape. \"Nothing misses these eyes.\"</p>\n<p>Marie realised that she was losing the upper hand and immediately narrowed her eyes sternly. She calmed her wavering mind and snapped down in protest, \"If Teacher Larks denies it, I will not become your disciple!\"</p>\n<p>As she punctuated her declaration, a subtle change transpired invisible to the eyes of everyone in the room barring Krish whose eyes nearly burst out of their sockets in shock.</p>\n<p>'This girl! She- She's changing the flow subconsciously!'</p>\n<p>\"Fine! Fine! I was only messing around with you!\" Krish barked back hastily. He noticed the shifting clouds of fate settle through his Heavenly Eye and heaved a sigh of relief. </p>\n<p>He then turned to Guy and commented cautiously, \"You know, back in the day, scores of mages would line up for days to enter my discipleship, only to be denied.\"</p>\n<p>Guy nodded with a mirthful exhale and said, \"They wanted to become your disciples, but were turned down by you. In this case, though, you were the one who proposed the discipleship to Marie. Therefore, she must also have the right to decline. Besides, she's told me something interesting about your power.\"</p>\n<p>He then leaned forward, cradled his chin on his palms and spoke with a measured and incisive tone, \"You said that Marie is fated with The Heavenly Eye. She cannot learn it if you don't teach her. If she doesn't learn it then it isn't technically her fault, but yours. Furthermore, it would lead to a deviation in the natural flow of fate, which, according to a little birdie, results in a backlash of some sort. Since you are the one at the centre of this deviation... I think you know where I am going with this.\"</p>\n<p>Krish wore a bitter expression and exhaled loudly in defeat. \"I misjudged you a little, Guy Larks... Fine, I'll appease your apprehension. You're here to determine if I am capable enough to be this girl's Master, correct?\"</p>\n<p>Without waiting for a response, Krish removed his suppressed cultivation and unleashed an invisible pressure in waves. It started breezily, but then quickly rose in strength with every passing second.</p>\n<p>Marie was the first to succumb to the pressure and lose her consciousness. She was then followed by Jean, whose expression didn't budge an inch. Markus managed to hold out for a while longer, but he too collapsed just as easily.</p>\n<p>'I can't gauge his cultivation! He's definitely stronger than I am. But by how much?' Guy thought to himself with great difficulty as he tried to withstand the increasing pressure.</p>\n<p>Once Markus slumped down into his seat, the rising tension plateaued, and then started to drop.</p>\n<p>\"Is this sufficient?\" Krish smirked.</p>\n<p>\"What is your cultivation realm?\" Guy asked through measured breaths as he tried to stabilise his racing heart.</p>\n<p>\"Higher than yours,\" the man answered cheekily. \"You didn't answer my question.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am comforted to know that you can protect Marie. But I still have some concerns about your cultivation art. You should know exactly why Marie is so inclined towards prediction and future sight.\"</p>\n<p>\"The girl desires control and surety.\"</p>\n<p>\"Exactly. And while I'm impressed by your track record and efficacy, I need to ascertain it one last time for my own peace of mind,\" Guy concluded.</p>\n<p>Krish nodded along in understanding and entered silent contemplation. He stayed that way for a whole minute before looking directly into Guy's eyes and speaking with a morose tone, \"When I came to this village, I inspected everyone present with my ability. At that time, I saw nothing of value in this village. It was shown that the village would remain as such for maybe half a century before decaying and fading away with time, just like every other place I passed through. But then the very next day, something happened. Everything changed! The village that was quaint and without purpose gained an auspicious coating unlike any other. It was surprising because this never happens.\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" Guy uttered in a low tone.</p>\n<p>\"It. Never. Happens. Fate is static, it never changes. People only think that they have control over their lives and their futures, but they don't. NO ONE can change fate. But then it did change!\"</p>\n<p>\"You said that you can change the future. Maybe it was the result of someone else like you-\"</p>\n<p>\"There is NO ONE else like me. Believe me. There is no other cultivation art in this world like The Heavenly Eye,\" Krish accentuated confidently.</p>\n<p>He then resumed his monologue, \"A change so drastic can only mean one thing: Someone strong- Someone immensely powerful had made a play. Someone strong enough to execute a shift so drastic and sudden, yet without causing nary a ripple!\"</p>\n<p>Krish showed a faint smile and said, \"I stayed here for maybe a year? Waiting for the cause to show up, after all the perpetrator returns to the scene of the crime nine-out-of-ten times. And that was when I saw you, Guy Larks - A man with a fate so murky he should be dead. Yet there he was, walking and talking without a hint of death lingering over him.\"</p>\n<p>Krish copied Guy's earlier posture and rested his chin on his hands. He then gazed intently at Guy's warped expression and directed a mote of his power to raise the tension.</p>\n<p>\"So, Guy Larks, exactly who, or what, are you?\"</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/pIgMOz5OH9thHBn1akX44\">Chapter 116 - Fated Master and Disciple</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/ejZNvV99zTqPHzxQbUGGS\">Chapter 114 - Safeguarding the Family</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance!

This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

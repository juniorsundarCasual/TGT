No one knew what had to be done to rbring the lost kids back, because no one knew where the kids disappeared off to in the first place. It was only after Shuri returned three-quarters of an hour later (alone) that the search was placed on a temporary hold.</p>\n<p>Apparently, even Marie did not know where they were, since it seemed as though the aftermath of the world collision had caused the usually unbending waves of fate to suddenly become entangled - \"an indecipherable mess\", were her exact words. Though Marie did affirm that whatever Mage Nara did, which resulted in his gruesome demise, had secured the safety of Dora and Kano till their return. It was a awe-inspiring realisation that one man who was at the veritable peak of power sacrificed everything for two little children. It brought on a whole new level of admiration for the now deceased man. Though Guy barely had the opportunity to dwell on it, because the moment Grace heard the confirmation of her children's safety, she dragged Guy and shepherded the Sect's \"upper management\" into the largest meeting room and plopped Guy right at the centre of the crowd.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean that you aren't from this world?\" Grace exclaimed in shock.</p>\n<p>\"It is exactly as I said,\" Guy affirmed. \"I'm not the Guy who was born in this world- well the body was born in this world, but the soul inhabiting it wasn't born here.\"</p>\n<p>\"There's another soul inside this body?\" Jean inquired while rubbing her chin.</p>\n<p>\"Yes- well I'd say there are two souls inside this body, technically,\" Guy answered with an awkward smile.</p>\n<p>\"So the old Guy Larks is still in there?\" Grace asked.</p>\n<p>\"No, the old Guy is dead, I'm the new Guy,\" Guy corrected.</p>\n<p>\"So then who's the second soul?\" Grace snapped irritatedly.</p>\n<p>\"He's the other Guy,\" Guy answered.</p>\n<p>\"Which other guy?\" Grace asked.</p>\n<p>\"No, no, his name is also Guy, he's just another version of me, I think- Look it's all very complicated,\" Guy said finally while letting out an exhausted sigh. \"Suffice to say, I died in my original world and my soul was brought into this world and injected into this body, who also happened to have the same name as me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why this body in particular?\" Grace asked while scrutinising Guy's body.</p>\n<p>\"I- Stop looking at me like that!\" Guy exclaimed while covering his chest and crotch with an exaggerated, affronted look. \"Why is it so hard to understand?\"</p>\n<p>\"Seriously?\" Grace scoffed. \"Everything you've just told us overturns our very understanding of the world as we know it, and you're asking me 'Why is it so hard to understand?'\"</p>\n<p>Guy scratched his forehead while sporting a wry smile, \"I mean, in a world where magic exits, and the impossible is quite literally a possibility, why is it so hard to fathom the concept of transmigration?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not that we don't understand, Master,\" Markus chimed in. \"It's just that all of... this is just too much to take in at once, you know? In just half a day, you've revealed that there are in fact other universes, that there are omniscient entities that create and manage these universes, that you are FROM another universe, and finally that, potentially, our world is coming to an end. This is on top of Dora and Kano's mysterious disappearance and Elder Nara's subsequent death.\"</p>\n<p>The room turned silent at Markus' grave words. The day truly had been like a rollercoaster that just kept going down without showing any signs of stopping.</p>\n<p>\"Look, I'm sorry for fooling you guys,\" Guy said to cut through the heavy atmosphere. \"I hope you understand that my duplicity wasn't voluntary. I was told not to reveal my origin to anyone.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what changed?\" Grace probed. \"Why the sudden candor?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, the world is ending,\" Guy answered while rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>And once again, a somber silence descended on the room.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Jean asked. \"What do we do?\"</p>\n<p>Guy looked around the room and was surprised to see a bunch of resolute faces staring back at him. A feeling of warmth washed over him as a realisation dawned on him. For one, these kids did not doubt a single word he'd said till this point, which was an insane fact. Guy likened himself to those doomsday cultists from back on Earth - he was quite literally predicting the end of the world and presenting scenarios beyond a person's realm of imagination, yet the kids still believed him. Secondly, they did not seemed the least bit faced by it. In fact, they looked even more invigorated. Was this confidence misplaced or justified? Could you even call it confidence, or would calling it foolishness be more apt.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, if it was confidence, Guy would be proud to have trained such fearless mages. If it was foolishness, Guy couldn't feel disappointed, as only foolishness begets foolishness, which would make him the king of all fools.</p>\n<p>\"The world could end today, or it could end tomorrow. Heck, it could even end in a hundred years from now,\" Guy said as he stood up from his seat. He slowly walked towards the largest window in the room which also looked towards the forest where the two kids disappeared.</p>\n<p>\"There is much I do not know about what is to come. All I know is that it is impending and inevitable. And as it stands, there is nothing we CAN do to stop the end of the world. All we can do is prepare for whatever is set to happen, which is also something we don't know,\" as Guy said this, he could feel the heat in the room die down. Although he appreciated the blind support his Sect Members were willing to give him, he did not want sheep in his Sect. \"I think it is pointless to swim in an ocean of uncertainty, when there is clearly something more productive that we can cast our focus on.\"</p>\n<p>As Guy said this, he pointed out the window in the general direction of the ravaged meadow. The message was clear.</p>\n<p>\"There are two kids that are alone, in trouble, and sorely in need of our help. We do not want Elder Nara's sacrifice to be in vain, do we?\" Guy asked with force in his voice. The members present backed down and simultaneously entered a contemplative state.</p>\n<p>\"I suspect some form of spacetime tomfoolery,\" Markus surmised. \"That tear was unlike anything I've ever seen before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Senior Brother Markus does have a point,\" Jean affirmed. \"The most advanced teleportation rituals tend to invoke a similar void-like portal as the tear that sundered the meadow.\"</p>\n<p>A flash of inspiration illuminated Markus' pupils. But just as he was about to speak his thoughts, Jean quickly splashed cold water all over him, \"Of course, I only know this through literature study. Such advanced teleportation rituals are no longer in use due to their impractical mana usage.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's okay, if we could at least replicate the magic in small scale it could offer an entryway to solve the bigger problem,\" Markus said with a hope-filled tone.</p>\n<p>\"I'll try to contact my father to see if we have copies of the ritual in our Clan's library,\" Jean answered while giving an affirmative nod.</p>\n<p>At that moment, Guy heard Grace mutter something that, if not for his highly sensitive hearing, he would have easily missed.</p>\n<p>\"Inheritance grounds...\" Grace said with a low voice.</p>\n<p>\"What about inheritance grounds?\" Guy probed further.</p>\n<p>\"Huh?\" Grace exclaimed in surprise. \"Oh, nothing!\"</p>\n<p>\"If there is knowledge to be shared, I think it will help all of us if you could do so openly,\" Guy suggested.</p>\n<p>Grace's expression turned conflicted before she hesitantly explained her thoughts. \"I think inheritance grounds exhibit a similar behaviour. The entry into an inheritance ground appears a lot like the advanced teleportation ritual Jean was referring to as well.\"</p>\n<p>For the third time, an awkward silence prevailed in the room. All the mages exchanged confused gazes as they processed what just happened. They weren't confused by what Grace had just said, they were surprised that Grace was the one who contributed.</p>\n<p>\"You seem to be... well-informed about this topic,\" Guy commented with furrowed brows. An inkling of a thought spawned in his mind, and as he saw Grace's face scrunch up in disgust with a faint trace of pain, he understood where she'd learned this from. \"Let us discuss this further in person, then.\"</p>\n<p>Grace massaged her elbow and nodded dimly. It was evident that just the thought had drained her of all energy. In the meantime, more and more ideas started to spill out from the members present. Some made sense, others didn't, but Guy didn't inhibit the flow because he was aware that they were all grasping at straws at this point. If Markus' hypothesis was true, and the cause of the anomaly had something to do with the spacetime continuum, then even Guy could do very little to help since even back on Earth, teleportation and the sort were just theories.</p>\n<p>As the discussion reached its peak, the door to the room slid open and Marie stepped in. All head turned towards her, as she walked in with decisive strides. She halted amidst the members, reached into the cloth bag that once belonged to her Master and retrieved a tattered journal.</p>\n<p>\"My Master has an extensive list of dimensional manipulation rituals and spells. I have personally been a part of one of them during my training,\" Marie said while carefully placing the journal on the nearby table. \"We could use this as a start.\"</p>\n<p>\"You should take your time, Marie,\" Guy expressed. \"Mourning is like unraveling a tangled thread - the more you rush it, the worse it gets.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have mourned enough,\" Marie interjected. \"Besides, my Master wouldn't want me to waste away my time mourning his passing. He chose this, and although it was my action that left him with very few options, it was a decision he did not regret - those were his final words.\"</p>\n<p>Guy could see that Marie was trying to put on a brave front, but the girl's faintly quivering voice gave away the pain she was experiencing. He slowly approached the girl who wore a steadfast front, and gently pulled her into a hug. A stifled whimper escaped Marie's lips, but she pulled it back immediately.</p>\n<p>As he slowly patted her back, Guy said, \"You're a strong girl. I know that. But crying isn't an act of weakness.\"</p>\n<p>The other members present slowly approached Marie and huddled into an impromptu group hug. Marie was grateful for that. All the bodies surrounding her muffled the sound of wailing as she let out the emotions bubbling inside her once again.</p>\n<p>Her Master was gone.</p>\n<p>And it was all her fault.</p>\n<p>Another person who loved and cared for her had left her. All alone. Abandoned.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/qw47w660bubc9csjzu1kw31\">Chapter 411 - Better Yesterday, Today, or Tomorrow</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/TGT/notes/ry1cptrvpy007aif8ui47qn\">Chapter 409 - Welcome to the Jungle</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","title":"The Good Teacher","desc":"","updated":1704920084194,"created":1643479838816,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"97ed7241a4594feec67aae35dd5ec391","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"miscellaneous","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":3,"offset":895},"end":{"line":17,"column":20,"offset":912},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"miscellaneous"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-1","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":3,"offset":915},"end":{"line":18,"column":15,"offset":927},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-1"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-2","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":948},"end":{"line":19,"column":15,"offset":960},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-2"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-3","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":983},"end":{"line":20,"column":15,"offset":995},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-3"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-4","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1018},"end":{"line":21,"column":15,"offset":1030},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-4"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"volume-5","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1053},"end":{"line":22,"column":15,"offset":1065},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"volume-5"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.NoHarem","alias":"#NoHarem","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":22,"offset":2510},"end":{"line":45,"column":30,"offset":2518},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.NoHarem"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"qbtgkpXE56GehWIIYUPlK","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"tags.LGBTQ+","alias":"#LGBTQ+","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":31,"offset":2519},"end":{"line":45,"column":38,"offset":2526},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"tags.LGBTQ+"}}],"anchors":{"summary":{"type":"header","text":"Summary","value":"summary","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"authors-note":{"type":"header","text":"Author's Note","value":"authors-note","line":37,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["hsfwh1drgon77m1i871e0g7","fcXPPXnqRPOkAUPWFcYHh","YmDf44XQK0snHWr4HCNuj","9BHUWZMl1JRvE5LoAphKR","hk3a0wjaksh6uap9l9fm0wn","enpadrm33suumrdjl5t6gt2","7f1i5ikp5i8gyae20lcyt09","24l34m2lf1dxtfcp94uyznb"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![Front_Cover](./assets/images/TGT_JUL2021.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuy Larks was famous in his original world for his widespread charity work in poverty-stricken and war-torn nations.\nHe was especially known for his efforts in developing schools and educational facilities for children, as well as teaching and nurturing many students.\n\nSo it was devastating news to learn that he wouldn't live past his 30th year.\n\nBut he was given a second chance! A new life in another world, as a down-by-the-dumps teaching apprentice in a world of magic and wonder. He was given no cheat, just a Repository of Knowledge holding all the information he could bring with him from his previous life.\n\nIn this new world, Guy rediscovered his life's true calling! Ride along on Guy's journey as he changes the world one budding mind at a time, as the greatest teacher this world has ever seen!\n\n**State of Story**:\n\n* [[miscellaneous]]\n* [[volume-1]] [COMPLETED][FREE]\n* [[volume-2]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-3]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-4]] [COMPLETED][LOCKED]\n* [[volume-5]] [ONGOING][LOCKED]\n\n**Discord**:\nhttps://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n\n**Expected Upload Frequency**: \n3 Chapters per Week \nw/ min. 1500 Words per Chapter\n\n## Author's Note\n\nThis is a slice-of-life-ish story at its core. This is NOT a hot-blooded, high-octane novel filled with conflicts and fights around every corner. If that is the kind of story you are looking for, unfortunately, you will not find it here (at least not in the early chapters).\n\nThe MC is a modern man, with modern sensibilities. Conflicts are handled civilly, or avoided altogether. There will be fights, but the story does not revolve around it.\n\nThe MC is mature, and handles relationships tactfully. There will be a slow-burn romance in this story, and ABSOLUTELY NO HAREM. I despise that genre from the bottom of my heart!\n\nI also have some LGBTQ+ elements planned for the future (with side characters).\n\nEnglish not first language. Writing mistake? Please forgive. Proofread many times before upload, problems not much. If issue, then point out mistake, I correct immediate. I am thank you for you're understanding :)\n\nALSO: I started writing this story with one intention in mind, and that was to act as a parody of existing novels with similar themes. However, around CH25, I realised that my work was becoming too derivative and boring. So I pivoted and decided to make my novel its own thing. I believe that my work has become better because of it.\n\n**Additional Tags:** #NoHarem #LGBTQ+\n\n____\n\n> Word Count:\n>\n> Check out my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PKbqtembQJ\n> \n> Please VOTE WITH POWER STONES, REVIEW and ADD TO COLLECTIONS :)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.83.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"The Good Teacher","description":"Repository of chapters","author":"Junior Sundar"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/juniorsundarCasual/TGT"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/TGT","siteUrl":"https://juniorsundarCasual.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"dark","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

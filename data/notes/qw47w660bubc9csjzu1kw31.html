<p>Something had changed that fateful day. Both Rianna and Shay-Hade could feel it and it was... uncomfortable. The whole aura that hung in the True World Sect had turned dour but emotionally charged - the atmosphere was heavy, and no one carried that uplifting, light-hearted smile that just subconsciously brightened her and Shay-Hade's day. But this was expected, after all. The loss of a Tesseract Transformation realm export, a veritable backbone of the Sect, was a heavy blow to the Sect's power ranking. Furthermore, it seemed that Mage Nara was quite close with the Sect's members, especially due to his position as Marie's Master. On top of that, they had just lost the two little kids through some freak accident of some sort.</p>
<p>Yet this shouldn't have been the cause of Rianna's discomfort. Mourning was common, something that Rianna had to experience a lot in her lifetime. But the ambience of the Sect superceded mourning and was delving into some other territory. It was guilt and self-loathing. Not everyone was drowning in it as hard as Marie, though, but it was a shared feeling nonetheless.</p>
<p>In fact, Rianna only narrowed down on this fact by carefully observing the behaviour of the Sect Members in a more scrutinising fashion. The hint was in the underlying motivation, or how it is perceived by a third-party observer. The members of the Sect did things with a specific motivation that guided them forward. Before they learned for the fun of learning and hope of applying their learning in real life. This open-mindedness meant that they tended to have more questions and often circled around the topic more carefully to grasp as much of it as possible - in a sense, they just had fun with it. But now their comportment had changed altogether.</p>
<p>For instance, Kili had doubled down on her workouts with unwavering focus. Although the girl adhered to the strict standards set by Rianna, she would skirt the line more often such as by implementing more frequent supersets, shortening rest times, and even taking every other workout till failure. Rianna could see that the girl was setting much higher standards for herself than before, and whenever she failed to meet those standards Rianna could hear quiet curses from the littel girl's mouth chastising herself for her shortcomings. While before, Kili saw the workouts as a fun exercise and a way to develop herself, now it had turned into a literal do-or-die situation in her mind. Did Rianna like this? Well... This was usually the attitude with which the members of her own Sect approached cultivation. So in a way, she was familiar with this attitude. But having worked in this Sect for the past few months had changed her perspective slightly. It felt much better to live amidst people who liked to enjoy living and understanding more of the world that existed around them, than those that secluded themselves and sought to reach greater heights at the expense of momentary happiness. Some things are best enjoyed as opportunities present themselves; what use is living to be five hundred years old, if you cannot enjoy the happiness that comes with being a silly teenager?</p>
<p>Rianna arrived at the tent she and Shay-Hade had set up in the forest and entered through the tarp to reveal the more spacious room within. Shay-Hade had already arrived following the day's combat training session. Usually, Rianna would enter and receive a warm welcome from a symphony of aromas dancing in the air. It seemed that touching base with Matron Reva had somehow sparked the latent chef hiding within Shay-Hade's tough exterior and had motivated the man to cook dishes from his homeland, which Rianna also found extremely delectable after trying them out. Unfortunately, though, today Rianna was disappointed to find no flavours tickling her smell centres, as her partner was simply sitting cross-legged with a conflicted yet contemplative expression on his face.</p>
<p>"What's gotten you so down?" Rianna inquired as walked over to the kitchen. Once again, she was disappointed to see the stove cold and devoid of any delectable treats. No matter, at this realm she didn't need to eat. At this point, she noticed that Shay-Hade still hadn't answered her question. She turned to look at her man, and saw that he was in his own world thinking about something.</p>
<p>"Hello?" She called again with a lighter tone while waving her hands exaggeratedly to draw Shay-Hade's attention.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rianna!" Shay-Hade exclaimed. "When did you come?"</p>
<p>"Just now."</p>
<p>He looked past her and towards the empty kitchen, and an apologetic smile formed on his face.</p>
<p>"It's fine," Rianna said. "I saw that you were deep in thought about something. An event like that is so rare that I am willing to overlook this slight."</p>
<p>Shay-Hade let out a deep chuckle before relaxing and uncrossing his legs. "Something's changed," he commented.</p>
<p>"I know," Rianna responded with a sympathetic hum.</p>
<p>"I didn't know what it was," Shay-Hade continued. "But I noticed that everyone was training much harder than usual in their combat lessons. Well, it wasn't like they were slacking off earlier, but now the motivation just feels very."</p>
<p>"Ramped up?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Shay-Hade affirmed while snapping his finger. "The thing is, they don't ask me questions anymore. They just do everything I ask them to do. I even tried relaying nonsensical instructions and they followed it!"</p>
<p>"I understand," Rianna said while rubbing Shay-Hade's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Just now," Shay-Hade added. "I got to thinking- which I realise is a rare occurrence. I never really did take time to think about the things that I do and experience. But a moment of introspection brought me a lot of clarity and made me understand why I was feeling so conflicted nowadays."</p>
<p>"Don't keep me in suspense," Rianna joked.</p>
<p>"I think being here has changed me as a person," Shay-Hade confirmed. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually enjoyed those little miscreants' barrage of questions. It made me think and understand more about what I knew, and guided me to learn more. But now, they've devolved into the same drab horde like back in our Sect- like in every other Sect in this entire world for that matter."</p>
<p>Rianna remained silent as she applied Shay-Hade's discovery to her own emotional predicaments. It was true, in a sense.</p>
<p>"I've identified that I've changed, but the problem is that I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing," Shay-Hade confessed. "Was I better the way I was before? Or am I better of the way I have become now?"</p>
<p>Rianna let out a long exhale and lay down on her back.</p>
<p>"Did you know that I was under the Sect Leader's tutelage for a few years back when I first joined the Sect?" Rianna revealed. "It wasn't a big deal, really. The Sect Leader was known to randomly pick up members and train them and then drop them when he felt they had grown sufficiently. It wasn't like I was anything special, there were others like me too - some were rich, others poor, some strong, others weak, some gifted, others sub-par. But the thing was, he trained everyone with the same level of seriousness. He never screwed around just because we were mundane cultivators without any special bloodline or physique. Everyone was treated fairly and equally."</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, that meant a lot to me," Rianna expressed. "Even if I was probably picked at random. But his dedication in training me moved me. Through introspection, I realised that it made me feel the parental affection that I sorely lacked in my younger years."</p>
<p>"Needless to say, I really respect the Sect Leader," Rianna admitted. "And he would always say that in cultivation and in life, the goal is to keep moving forward. When you stop one day and look back, you shouldn't be able to recognise the person you once were. But what direction is forward?"</p>
<p>Shay-Hade leaned in as Rianna paused to let the Sect Leader's words settle.</p>
<p>"He said that the direction forward can only be decided by you and you alone. If you don't know which direction it is, then a good way to test things is by asking yourself what makes you happy? If doing something and being a certain way makes you happy, then try doing that. Live that way for a while and see if at any point, when you look back, you feel better than you did before."</p>
<p>Shay-Hade scratched his forehead and spoke up cautiously, "But I feel like that doesn't provide a robust indicator of whether I am better now than when I was before!"</p>
<p>Shay-Hade knew that questioning Rianna's idol so openly was a surefire way of losing a limb. But surprisingly, what he received was a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"That's the thing! What matters is the feeling you have at the present moment. Do you feel better now than you did before? If so, then good, you are moving forward. But if in the future you realise that you don't feel better and happier than you did in the past, it only means that somewhere along the way, the path forward had changed direction and you just didn't realise it. All you have to do is trace your steps back and alter the way you live," Rianna expounded. "It is never too late to change. Well, a person can't REALLY change, but they can grow. And surprisingly, even deterioration is considered growth, just in a downwards direction."</p>
<p>"So what you're saying is that I am better now than I was before?" Shay-Hade probed.</p>
<p>"Didn't you heard a word I said!" Rianna exclaimed while smacking her man's head. "Ask yourself if you feel better and happier the way you are now that you were before?"</p>
<p>"I do," Shay-Hade answered without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>"There you go!" Rianna congratulated. "Now that we have our personal struggles out of the way, can we please have something tasty to eat. I am feeling extremely dull today and I need some colour!"</p>
<p>Shay-Hade let out a deep, bellowing laugh as he stood up, "Coming right up, Madam!"</p>

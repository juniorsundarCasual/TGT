<p>"Actually... I've been lying to you, Mr. Jeeves," Guy started, causing Al to shift uncomfortably in his seat. He already knew it, but hearing it out loud still left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>After a deep exhale, Guy continued, "I didn't read any books written by a long-forgotten race. But please don't misunderstand. I didn't lie because I wanted to deceive you in any way. It's just that... I was deeply ashamed."</p>
<p>As he finished the sentence, the expression on his face drooped significantly. Al, who was paying close attention to Guy's facial queues for any specific tells, was surprised to notice genuine sorrow in Guy's eyes.</p>
<p>"You see, back when the academy implemented the new rules regarding teaching apprentices and the tournament, I was devastated. I knew that I wouldn't amount to much in this life, and the stringent requirements imposed in this new format would mean that there would be a high chance of me losing all possibility of ever becoming a teacher in this lifetime."</p>
<p>Guy shrugged as he added, "I only wanted a stable job. Something that could support me until my death. I never had any expectations of becoming successful or revered in this world. And that was why I had gambled everything on this venture."</p>
<p>"Because of that, on the day I learned of the changes... I attempted suicide," Guy declared as he hung his head in shame.</p>
<p>This revelation registered an involuntary gasp from Al. Evidently, this discussion was going in a completely different direction from what he had expected. He never thought that a happy-go-lucky person such as Guy was at the end of his ropes. He never showed any obvious signs.</p>
<p>Guy didn't bother with the audience's reaction, and continued, "The day I solidified that decision, I tied a rope around my neck and hanged myself."</p>
<p>"But then, at the moment when the last ounce of breath left my lungs, I saw something-" Guy suddenly ramped up his explanation. Involuntarily, his voice morphed into his teaching voice and his body animated with heightened fervour. Unable to contain himself, Guy stood up from his seat and waved his hand while continuing, "I saw a vision! A world similar to ours, but different in many ways! A world void of mana and magic. A world ruled by a dominant species known as the Homo Sapiens."</p>
<p>As he turned towards Al, Guy exhorted, "Everything else I told you was the truth! I was provided with a large influx of knowledge, of various things from that world. Much of it felt foreign to me, but at the same time, it made sense! It was nearing the end of this revelation that I saw the essence of this different world, The True World!"</p>
<p>Guy spread his arms wide and orated unimpededly, "I knew that this was a sign! The revelation and the information it provided was too specific to be otherwise. And so, I fought against my impending doom and saved myself. But afterwards, I was sceptical. I didn't know if what I saw was the truth or whether it was simply a figment of my imagination - a fantasy stitched up by my mind starved of oxygen."</p>
<p>Guy closed his hands and extended his index finger while pulling Al's undivided attention, "However! The moment I succeeded in creating that modular spell, I knew! I just knew that it was all real!"</p>
<p>Guy then paused. He wanted to catch his breath and let the outburst of information ferment in Al's mind.</p>
<p>As he sat down, he continued in a hushed tone, "When you asked me about how I learned all of this, I was apprehensive. I was ashamed to admit the grave decision I made at a moment of weakness. I didn't want you to see me as a weak-willed coward. And for that, I apologise profusely!"</p>
<p>Al absorbed the information as it left Guy's mouth, and slowly calmed his tightened nerves. For one thing, he was glad to see that there wasn't a hint of misrepresentation. So he was assured that everything that was just spoken was the truth.</p>
<p>However, the issue was never whether Guy was being truthful or not. Al was more concerned about the source of the knowledge. People that have lived for a long time have naturally learned to be more sceptical about things they see and observe. Experience through age played a huge role in this.</p>
<p>Most beings forget to question the source, credibility and danger associated with the knowledge that comes their way. Maybe it is the result of the underlying philosophy to grow stronger regardless of the method that prevails in this world. This was something his previous student fell victim to, and because of that Al was especially perceptive of such matters.</p>
<p>The moment Al heard Guy's complete confession, he was completely relieved. Why? That was because Al was familiar with the kinds of visions Guy was alluding to. Not that he had ever experienced it himself, but Al had read of and heard of similar experiences through his travels and interactions with various mage powerhouses.</p>
<p>What Guy described strongly alluded to an event when a mage activates and internalises an inheritance!</p>
<p>An inheritance, when it comes to cultivation and magehood, mainly refers to the consolidation of a mage's entire cultivation and will which exists in transferable form. A mage can "inherit" another's cultivation through many forms. The easiest, and crudest, is to internalise a mage's core which forms once they break through into the Core Formation realm. It is a construct that forms once a mage advances and "solidifies" their cultivation. After death, this core quickly dissipates, however, another mage can absorb this and make it their own.</p>
<p>While this method is easy, it is inefficient and possibly dangerous. The mage can very easily deviate their own cultivation by absorbing another mage's raw will, or core, especially if the incoming cultivation is incompatible or conflicting with their own. Furthermore, the mage will have to actively absorb and decipher the insights from the core, otherwise, it cannot be internalised. This effectively means that a large portion of the core can be lost in the process.</p>
<p>This, however, is not the only way for a mage to gain an inheritance. A more efficient, albeit difficult, process is to gain it through an inheritance artefact. These are physical manifestations of a mage's cultivation that are formed willingly by a mage that enters the Ascension realm. These artefacts may be in the form of weapons, armours, trinkets, or in many cases a portal into another dimensional realm. Al knew of this solely through infrequent chatter and obscure letters. Information on inheritance artefacts is closely guarded by large organisations, or lucky individuals, to not attract attention from unwelcome parties.</p>
<p>The reason inheritance artefacts are more efficient is because the cultivation and will stored in them are immutable and eternal. Once transferred, the artefact does not become inert. Furthermore, the transference is not a massive information dump. Instead, the artefact either instils the information in a steady and manageable stream or waits for the inheritor to achieve an activation condition.</p>
<p>With regards to these inheritances. Al had heard of and read of many different explanations. For some, it is as if insights simply manifest inside their minds. Almost as if they were a forgotten memory that was recollected all at once. For others, it is as if the inheritor is shown a long and extremely immersive vision spanning multiple lifetimes, condensed into an infinitesimal time frame. Some records state that these visions are manifestations of the original mage's own experiences, successes and failures. In other cases, these visions are more obscure or cryptic, displaying farfetched or unbelievable concepts. While this may sound convoluted, this method may actually make it easier for the inheritor to internalise the transferred cultivation and will.</p>
<p>And so, Al likened the almost nonsensical vision that Guy experienced to a revelation provided by an ascended mage's inheritance. The cultivation may have been too obscure or out of this world which warranted a vision of that form. Evidently, it helped as Guy was able to grasp a large influx of information very easily. Al figured that Guy may have once in his lifetime come into contact with an inheritance artefact that imprinted this information inside him. When Guy entered a limbo state between life and death, it must have met an activation condition for transference!</p>
<p>Thus, Al was satisfied. In fact, he was even a little honoured and moved to receive a glimpse into another mage's inheritance. These things were supposed to be secrets that mages took to their graves, or passed down to people closest to them. Al was a little conflicted because he felt as if there was a huge debt weighing down on him. Inadvertently, Guy had just gained a very powerful backer.</p>
<p>As these thoughts were running through Al's head, he had entered a dormant-like state. Guy observed that Al was in deep contemplation, and was satisfied to know that his explanation was observed positively.</p>
<p>Guy's unadulterated confession was filled with passion. No research or facts was supporting it. So Guy was a little worried that there might have been some loopholes or inconsistencies. Well, Guy had overlooked the convincing powers of a feverous missionary. Some dudes in his old world even managed to convince thousands of people that their souls would be consumed by aliens after death!</p>
<p>Although, that one may have an inkling of truth to it...</p>
<p>In the end, while he submitted to the impulses provided by this soul partition, Guy's supreme rationality was blaring vehemently. Seeing as this mask was no longer necessary, Guy quickly regressed into his RoK, no... The Church.</p>
<p>Once he entered, he beheld the very unfamiliar endless hall from his raised dais. Guy suppressed his growing urge to preach unintelligible drivel to the nonexistent congregation and pulled off his mask.</p>
<p>The moment the object lifted off his skin, his sights morphed drastically.</p>
<p>As he came to, he found himself back in the familiar centre of the RoK. Guy sighed in relief and carefully placed the mark in his hands on the table next to him.</p>
<p>He stared at it with conflicted emotions. He wanted nothing more than to get rid of this portal, which was akin to a dark and corrupted hole into madness, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.</p>
<p>A part of himself was attached to this mask, and he knew subconsciously that it would be impossible to get rid of it.</p>
<p>(We'll need to experiment with that. I think the reason for this soul partition has a lot to do with the RoK,) Mast spoke up from over Guy's shoulder.</p>
<p>Guy's head darted around and landed on Mast's figure walking towards the shelves of the RoK.</p>
<p>As Guy lowered his gaze he saw the books in Mast's hand.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with those?" Guy interrogated while rushing towards Mast.</p>
<p>(I'm putting them in the -) but before he could finish, Guy quickly grabbed the stack and threw them with gusto.</p>
<p>(What are you doing?) Mast asked in confusion.</p>
<p>"Those books will NOT be placed in this library! I refuse! Burn them for all I care!" Guy declared righteously.</p>
<p>(But you just threw them deeper into the RoK...) Mast grumbled as he strode over to fetch the books.</p>
<p>Guy harrumphed and resolutely shook his head. He had already bent his morals to read through that... literature. He was now suffering the consequences of it. He was NOT going to taint his beautiful haven of knowledge with them!</p>
<p>With a flourish Guy exited the RoK, leaving Mast to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>Once he returned to reality, he saw the Al had digested everything.</p>
<p>"Actually, Mr. Jeeves. I came here today to ask you for a favour," Guy asked.</p>
<p>Al was no longer apprehensive about associating himself with Guy. He was a bit more enthusiastic, and so, he acquiesced readily, "Sure! As long as it is within my power."</p>

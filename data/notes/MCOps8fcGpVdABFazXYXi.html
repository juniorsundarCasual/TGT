<p>Goran and Al set out for Guy's village with Jean a few days later. While Goran, Al and Josie could fly using magic, Jean could not, thus they decided to make the journey the 'mortal way'.</p>
<p>However, in order to not attract unwanted attention from wary clan members, bandits, and ne'er-do-wells, they opted to take a simple, unassuming looking caravan. It would blend in with the other caravans traversing the route.</p>
<p>Although they shouldn't have to fear such intrusions, given their cultivation realm, Goran and Al both agreed that it was unwise to broadcast the fact that two magic powerhouses were travelling together to a remote village. Spreading this would obviously raise multiple red flags, especially within the mage circles.</p>
<p>The caravan they travelled in was comprised of two carriages. The one leading the group was for Al and Goran, while the other, more comfortable one was reserved for their precious cargo, Jean.</p>
<p>Thankfully, their travel was generally pleasant and without any hindrance. They managed to reach the midway point, a transit town known as Wayward, which acted as the junction where most merchant caravans rested prior to continuing the long journey through the forest and the mountain range.</p>
<p>Over the years, the town had evolved from a quaint residential gathering into a more commercial centre, open to trade. Thus, the streets of the town were filled with temporary stalls that were set up on short notice by these travelling caravans. Apart from these haphazardly raised stalls, the town also acted as a means of short- to long-term employment for those seeking means to earn money. People could access the merchants or other trade guilds established within the town and respond to advertisements seeking hands.</p>
<p>Although the town appeared vibrant and lively, it had actually persisted since before the start of the current dynasty. The Maika Duchy recognised the value of this town, especially due to its closeness to Radiant City, and had made it a point to maintain and protect it from elements both internal and external.</p>
<p>Therefore, to enter or transit through the town, one had to undergo a thorough check by the guards stationed near the peripheries, documenting every single being that set foot within the confines of the town.</p>
<p>For entities such as Goran who had the backing of a prolific clan, bypassing this documentation process wasn't a hassle. All it took was flashing the clan leader's seal and greasing the palms of the guard captains with a few gold coins, and they were personally escorted to the most luxurious inn in town by the captains themselves.</p>
<p>After settling down in the inn for the day, Goran and Al decided to fly ahead to make sure that the path was safe for the next day's travel.</p>
<p>"I'm a little bored, Josie," Jean said with a sigh. "I've been sitting in the carriage the entire day. Although it can dissipate the shocks, I still feel quite sore."</p>
<p>"This servant will massage the Young Miss at once," Josie suggested.</p>
<p>"No. Instead, I want to go out for a stroll. Check out the market!" Jean declared with some excitement, although it was not evident on her expressionless face.</p>
<p>"But Young Miss, Lord said that it would be best if we stayed put..."</p>
<p>"Come on, Josie! With you around, what's the worst that could happen? I mean, unless we cross someone at the Core Formation realm or above, you should be able to take them down. Besides, with the guards maintaining vigilance on those entering and exiting the town, I don't think we will have any problems," Jean replied to persuade Josie.</p>
<p>"Young Miss, we should not test fate by making such claims," Josie said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Whatever, Josie I'm going!" Jean declared while sauntering out of her room.</p>
<p>"Young Miss... Please don't rush..." Josie uttered with a sigh of defeat.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Tsk... These herbs are all in their last legs..." Jean commented as she left the last stall in the row.</p>
<p>"That is expected, Young Miss. The stalls mostly sell goods that are prone to perishing during transit through the forest, damaged during transportation, or exceeding caravan capacity. That is why they are at a lower price point since the merchants want to recoup their losses, and optimally break even," Josie explained.</p>
<p>"That makes sense..."</p>
<p>As the two walked back towards the inn, a strange conversation drifted out from a nearby alley.</p>
<p>"Let go of me you creep!" A forceful feminine voice resonated.</p>
<p>SLAP!</p>
<p>"Damn it! You bitch! This is what I get after taking pity on you and giving you a job?" A growling masculine voice retorted, tinged with anger.</p>
<p>"If I had known that sleeping with the employer was part of the job description, do you think I would have accepted your offer?"</p>
<p>"Why else would I have given such an important job of maintaining the caravan's finances to a girl of all people?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, maybe because you were a decent human being?"</p>
<p>"Get back here!"</p>
<p>Jean scooted over and peeked around the corner leading into the alley and observed the confrontation. She saw a girl, maybe a year or two older than herself, being surrounded by a group of men, led by a hefty man.</p>
<p>Seeing how the girl was at such a disadvantage, Jean felt distressed and whispered to Josie, "Should we help her out?"</p>
<p>Josie answered, "Lord said to not draw attention to ourselves, Young Miss..."</p>
<p>"But she's outnumbered..." She said bitterly and said, "How can I call myself a healer if I can't even help a defenceless person?"</p>
<p>Josie released a long exhale in contemplation and moved forward to step in. However, before she could do so, a series of familiar sounds interrupted her.</p>
<p>BANG! CRASH! PLOP!</p>
<p>"AAGH!"</p>
<p>Jean peaked around that corner once again, only to notice the girl standing over the prone body of the fat man, with all of his thugs rolling in pain on the ground. The girl stomped on the fat man's crotch and spoke menacingly over his wails, "Do you think this is my first time? Please! See this knife in my hand? This has emasculated many reckless employers such as yourself. You can ask the merchants guild representative here. They call me 'The Man-Unmaker'. I bet you never even considered looking up my credentials with the guild, right?</p>
<p>She leaned forward and spoke with a low yet threatening tone, "I'm gonna be lenient with you since you were nice enough to actually pay me on time, and include me on two tours. That is the only reason you are walking away today with your dignity intact. There won't be the next time, understood?!"</p>
<p>The fat man nodded vehemently in fear, to which the girl declared, "Good!" before stomping down on his crotch once again.</p>
<p>As the girl walked away, one of the men rolling on the floor got back up on their feet and unsheathed a knife from their ankles.</p>
<p>"Crazy bitch!" He yelled while rushing over to her turned back.</p>
<p>The girl turned to face her assailant, surprisingly without a tinge of fear in her eyes. Yet, before the knife could plunge down on her chest, the man was frozen in place. Not metaphorically, literally frozen in place, in a mass of ice.</p>
<p>"It is unwise to turn one's back to the enemy, especially if said enemy is still alive and breathing," Josie said as she stepped forth.</p>
<p>The girl observed Josie with an incisive gaze before saying, "Thank you for your help, but I had it under control."</p>
<p>The girl jerked her cuffs to reveal a hidden dagger, and grinned deviously. "As I said, this wasn't my first time."</p>
<p>The grovelling men paying attention to the confrontation all shuddered in fear at her bold declaration.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, I am grateful for your intervention. Not everyone would do so in such circumstances," the girl said while bowing towards Josie.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't thank me, but the Young Miss. It was she who took pity on you," Josie corrected while directing her hand towards Jean.</p>
<p>The girl bowed once again towards Jean and said, "Then this peasant is infinitely grateful towards the Young Miss for her benevolence."</p>
<p>Jean quickly waved her hand and replied, "Please! It wasn't anything."</p>
<p>"No! I disagree. While I declared that I could have handled the situation, there was no guarantee of my survival. So in many ways, your intervention tilted the scales in my favour. Hence, I am indebted to you. However, I do not like being in others' debt since it is often hard to quantify. Furthermore, it is also weirdly subject to interest over time. Therefore, I would like to repay this debt immediately by offering my services in any way possible," the girl replied with a serious expression.</p>
<p>"I... I don't know what to say," Jean confessed.</p>
<p>"It matters not. I can do anything. I have a lot of experience working as a finance consultant or treasurer for merchant caravans. I have also worked extensively as a cleaner, cook, handmaiden, you name it," the girl replied enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"I also have a lot of experience travelling around these parts, I can act as a guide if that is necessary."</p>
<p>Hearing the last part, Jean's eye lit up, "Do you happen to know a village called Twilight Village?"</p>
<p>The girl seemed taken aback by that question. She replied cautiously, "I do... I am from Twilight Village."</p>
<p>"That's great! We are actually travelling that way. Since you are so hell-bent on repaying your debt, why don't you act as our guide?" Jean asked while glancing at Josie from the corner of her vision.</p>
<p>After a quick analysis, Josie relented and gave a nod of affirmation.</p>
<p>"Sure! Then I will be at your service," the girl said while bowing for the third time.</p>
<p>Jean nodded and introduced herself, "I am Jean Rasmus, and this is Josie. We will be under your care from now on."</p>
<p>"My name is Marie Reva, you can call me Marie," The girl responded.</p>
<p>Jean furrowed her brows upon hearing her name, "Reva... Are you related to Markus Reva by any chance?"</p>
<p>"Markus? How do you know Markus?" Marie bombarded back in shock. "Did he do something stupid to cross you in any way? Please, I apologise on his behalf! He's a stupid brat, I'll punish him personally. You know what, I will do it in front of you until you are satisfied!"</p>
<p>Jean's eyes widened in surprise while Josie chuckled from behind.</p>
<p>"It seems that our meeting here was fate," Jean blurted in a low tone.</p>

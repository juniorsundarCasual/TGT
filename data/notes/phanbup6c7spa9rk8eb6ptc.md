Kano was not prepared for such a question. To him, it was as though someone was asking what a shoe was. A shoe was a shoe, how could you explain that?

"These stories, they have to be written somewhere, right?" Kano tried.

"They are," Kam answered while pointing at the wall.

"No, no," Kano hasitly responded while walking over to the closest segment of the mural and pointed at a scene. He let his fingers drift over the raises and dips while letting his eyes scroll over the beautifully etched dwarven script that grew increasingly bright with an ethereal purple glow. Slowly, his vision melted as a vivid scene started to play out before him. Two dwarves, one working diligently to earn a living by selling his wares, and the other sneering at his friend with visible jealousy in his eyes. The former worked hard and earned a wealth of coins in return. The latter did nought by look on enviously, until it reached a point where he succumbed to the poisonous emotion and stabbed his friend in the back, appropriating all the money the man had earned through honest blood, sweat and tears. But his outburst was not clean, as evidence eventually led to him being arrested and put to death by decapitation.

"How is this story shared?" Kano retried.

"How is any story shared?" Kan responded with a tone that implied that Kano was asking a stupid question with an obvious answer.

Kano looked at the man and awaited answer to his question, but none came. It seemed that Kam's retort in the form of a question was the answer itself.

"Do you just give a piece of this wall when someone wants to make a new mural?" Kano probed.

Kam let out a mirthful bellow that caused the man to bounce visibly.

"Of course not, my boy," Kam said after his fit of laughter settled. "Stories are just stories. They are known. Those who know can transmit it. I know all the legends etched into these walls. If someone were to ask me to replicate it, I could. Though how well I can replicate this will depend on my skill level in handling a chisel, and how well I understand the core message of the story."

"But these are laws," Kano argued. "What if a person's understanding of the legend does not align with the intended meaning. There is no way that two people can take the same message out of the same story."

"Take a look again," Kam encouraged. "And by that, I mean REALLY take a good look at the legends and try to understand them."

Kano did as told and observed the comic-like stories across the massive mural. He let the scenes play out in their entirety, making sure to not miss a single detail as they presented themselves before him. Eventually, he started to notice a trend.

"It is never about a specific person, place or time," Kano commented. "Each legend is impersonal, universal, and timeless. Which means that the interpretation is never left open. A dwarf steals an item, all that matters is that a theft took place. There is no place to question the reason for the theft. There is no place to question the outcome following the theft. It is either right, or wrong."

"Exactly!" Kam affirmed. "If there is no leeway to misinterpret the legends, then the legend becomes transferable exactly as it is."

"But what if the thief has extraordinary circumstances? I mean, is it right to punish a person based on the crime alone? What if they had no choice, like they were starving and about to die? Sure, stealing is wrong, but should the punishment for theft in order to survive be the same as for theft for the sake of thievery?" Kano probed worriedly.

"Theft is theft," Kam reiterated with certainty. "And there is always an option. Would you rather fill your stomach with food earned through honourless means, or die starving but with your honour intact?"

Kano's answer to that was the former. Always the former. The lad had tasted starvation in his life before living with Matron Reva. At that time, honour meant very little to the boy. Honour couldn't be eaten. Honour wouldn't stop the incessant rumbling of his stomach. Honour couldn't stop the pain and weakness from draining him every second of the day.

Kano found it odd that someone would hold honour above self-sustenance. He wanted to express his opinion on this, but he held his tongue. He was just a child, but he had the awareness to understand that it would do him no good to antagonise the very person who would provide him with sustenance, shelter and safety while he was in an unknown place. So, Kano took the evasive route and offered a thoughtful yet understanding hum, which seemed sufficient as Kam returned a smile and patted Kano's shoulders.

"So back to my earlier point," Kano continued as they walked through the hallways. "You really don't have books here."

"As I said, lad, I don't know what a book is."

"It's basically a collection of pages bound together and packaged with a harder cover, usually made of leather or wood. The pages contain information about a specific theme or topic. Most of the times they are just stories," Kano explained thoughtfully.

"That sounds like a waste of good parchment," Kam said while clicking his tongue disappointedly. "Is there a lot of wood where you come from?"

"Well..." Kano did live near a forest.

"For your information, wood is a valuable resource in the Fel realm," Kam explained. "Due to the generally adversarial environmental conditions above ground, not much that reflects green and breathes tends to survive. Heck, the most expensive part of my axe here-" he said while retrieivng the large double-edged battle-axe hanging on his back, "-is the handle! Can you believe that? I've heard stories of Gaea and the Fae Realm - realms doused in bountiful green and brown. Is it true what they say- well you wouldn't know what THEY say, but I guess you know what I mean?"

"W-Well, I lived next to a forest. There were a lot of trees there. We use the wood from there for a lot of different purposes. But my father always says that we must return what we take from the lands, so we always plant seeds that will sprout into new trees whever we chop one down," Kano explained.

"Must be amazing to live amongst all that..." Kam commented wistfully. "I remember a time when I was younger and still studying in the community school when we had a field trip to Old Gurum's Farm. He used to be the largest supplier of wood in the city - until he died and his sons gutted the business into five pieces and ruined everything. During the trip, my friends and I snuck away from the pack and climbed up a few trees and just lay there. The air was fresh and uplifting - it was so relaxing that we fell asleep for hours. We woke up to the sound of loud bells and screams. Apparently, we had been out of commission for the entire day, and our teacher thought that we had been kidnapped or killed and arranged a search involving everyone in the city!"

"What did you parents say when they found you?" Kano inquired, enamoured by the way in which Kam expressed the anecdote.

"Well, you can imagine their reaction. It was embarrassing to say the least," Kam said with a light chuckle. "But hey! A story came out of it, and that's what matters, after all. A dwarf should aim to have a storeyed life. It is the way we grow and advance as individuals and mages."

At this point, the duo arrived at a new section of the building which was a lot more populated, where dwarves of different appearances bustled about industriously doing their jobs (whatever it was).

Kam ushered Kano to counter occupied by a female dwarf, and one who looked older than Elder Bogum in appearance but was much younger than her since Kam called the woman by her first name.

"Dodi, oh sweet cousin of mine!" Kam greeted with a laugh.

"I should've known it would be you when my colleagues complained of a sudden stench of dead fish in the area," Dodi responded with a welcoming smile. "What brings you here today? No way, did sister-in-law get blessed with a little Kam?"

"Unfortunately, no," Kam responded with a thin smile. "BUT, we do have some good news! I would like to register this lad here, Kano..."

"Reva," Kano offered.

"Kano Reva under my household," Kam expressed with a proud smile.

"Adopted one now, admirable, cousin," Dodi expressed before looking at Kano over her reading glasses, "Huh?"

"Umm... Cousin, pardon my rudeness but... what is this?"

"This is Kano Reva, a human with dwarven blood," Kam responded matter-of-factly.

"He's about your height, cousin. How old is he?" Dodi probed while scratching her head.

"I'm eight, turning nine," Kano answered.

"What?!" Dodi yelped, attracting the attention of her colleagues. She coughed and urged them to carry on, doing whatever they were.

"How tall do humans usually get?" Dodi continued.

"Umm..." Kano looked up and calculated mentally. "About a bit more than twice my height, I guess."

Dodi choked on her saliva in shock while a red tint started to form on her cheeks. "Oh my... I read somewhere that an individual's height is proportional to their other... assets," she mumbled with a faint grin.

Kam immediately covered Kano's ears and chided his cousin, "Get those dirty thoughts out of your head or else I will talk to brother-in-law about your fantasies."

Dodi growled angrily before retrieving a rectangular stone tablet from beneath her desk and a chisel.

"Now, Kano, tell me about yourself. How did you get here? Human's aren't native to the Fel Realm, so your story must be quite thrilling," Dodi asked before fixing her glasses and perking her ears in anticipation.

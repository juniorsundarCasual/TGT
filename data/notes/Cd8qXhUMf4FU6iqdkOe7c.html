<p>The Common methods are the lowest tiers. </p>

<p>These work for 80-90% of the population.</p>

<p>Higher than Common method and can provide more insights. They are generally a continuation or expansion of Common methods and can usually carry the mage through their entire cultivation journey. Within the Common and Advanced tier, there are implicit subdivisions that depend on the specificity, relatability, applicability, and similar factors pertaining thot he method itself.</p>

<p>Kano understood the magnitude of his current situation quite well. He was all alone, stranded, in a land that was very far away from home (possibly even in a whole other planet altogether), with no way to return. It was a depressing realisation, but one that he hadn't had the chance to properly process. Because ever since he landed on this planet, he'd been exposed to one shocking event after another. Being nearly buried alive, surviving an attack from a salamander, meeting a dwarf- meeting a whole civilisation of dwarves, facing trial in said civilisation of dwarves, and finally, learning that he possibly had dwarven blood coursing through his veins.</p>
<p>He looked up at the council of five dwarves with a wavering that turned blurry repeatedly as tears started to accumulate on his eyes.</p>
<p>"Since the child is a dwarf by blood and without any guardian, we should move him into the Public Childcare System," the dwarf on the far left said with a thoughtful expression. "It is the standard procedure with every dwarven child that finds themselves orphaned."</p>
<p>"It will be tough since he does not know of our culture and traditions," Elder Bogum, the kind female Dwarf pointed out. "It would be a no-brainer had the child been a dwarf to begin with and was exposed to the society from the very beginning. He will struggle to assimilate with his fellow dwarves, and no family will want to adopt him given his differences."</p>
<p>"Would you like to adopt him, Elder Bogum?" The dwarf at the centre inquired.</p>
<p>"Ha! This old lady has enough on her hands already. My ten great-great-great grandchildren are already a handful, I would rather not have another on my plate," the woman said with a light scoff. "I'm sorry little one," she then said directly to Kano. "Its neither fair on me or you."</p>
<p>Kano rubbed his eyes and expressed in a low voice, "I want to go back home..."</p>
<p>"I fear that it isn't a possibility at the moment," the dwarf at the centre said while shaking his head apologetically. "We know very little about what brought you here as well. We only have assumptions to go off of-"</p>
<p>"It's the Great Devourer, I tell you!" Elder Bolin exclaimed while slamming his fist onto the stone dais.</p>
<p>"The Great Devourer is a myth," the dwarf on the far right responded.</p>
<p>"Are you questioning the Great Thror the Vanquisher's accounts?!" Elder Bolin challenged with an infuriated edge in his tone.</p>
<p>"Thror's records of his fight against the Great Devourer are at least eight-thousand years old. And there are no other records to corroborate those legends-"</p>
<p>"Thror's Battleaxe is a Legendary grade Enchanted weapon. I think that is proof enough regarding the veracity of the legend," Elder Bolin said with a snort. His body-language showed that he was no longer open to any discussion on the matter.</p>
<p>"Returning to the discussion at hand-," the central dwarf reminded with a booming cough. "Let us declare that the child needs to find a family to stay with."</p>
<p>"No one will like having a kid suddenly foisted upon them," the left most dwarf stated.</p>
<p>"This is a waste of time, I will take the kid in!" Elder Bolin declared righteously. "I will teach him the Dwarven ways and turn him into a proud and upstanding Dwarf ready to contribute and lift the society to greatness."</p>
<p>"I don't think that is a good idea..." The dwarf on the right mumbled.</p>
<p>"And why would that be?!" Elder Bolin sniped while snapping his head in the young dwarf's direction.</p>
<p>"Umm..." the young dwarf fumbled hastily for an explanation before fianlly snapping his fingers and saying, "Supporting a child so young is an intensive task. It will ultimately distract the Elder from his cultivation pursuits and his responsibilities in governance."</p>
<p>The Elder dwarf glared at the younger one for a few seconds before nodding affirmatively. "You're right. I won't be able to do justice to myself nor to the people I am bound to serve and lead."</p>
<p>All other dwarves in the room (and even Kano) let out an imperceptible breath of relief as the Elder voluntarily stepped down.</p>
<p>An awkward silence then hung in the room as the dwarves in the council exchanged looks amongst themselves. While everyone agreed that Kano could not be simply injected into the system, someone had to take on the responsibility.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that a long forgotten and ignored voice bumped into their midst. It was the same red-haired dwarf that had brought Kano here.</p>
<p>"Umm, I can take him," the dwarf offered. This statment caused the council to turn towards him with earnest gazes.</p>
<p>"Mister Bruin, it is a heavy responsibility. One that you should discuss with your family," Elder Bogum reminded cautiously, but it was clear that she was hoping the red-haired dwarf wouldn't change his mind.</p>
<p>"It's fine. My wife and I have been trying to conceive for a few years now - unsucessfully. The boy and I are destined, it seems," the dwarf said with longing in his gaze. "If the world has decided that I am to help this child, who am I to deny it?"</p>
<p>"An admirable sentiment, Kam," the central dwarf said with a proud nod. "Your decision has brought great honour to you and your family."</p>
<p>Kam shrugged before walking up to Kano and placing an arm over his shoulder. "Let us get you registered."</p>
<p>Kano looked at the adult who was about his size with a blank expression.</p>
<p>As the two exited the chambers, the dwarf spoke up first, "You know, I would like to start by apologising. I tied you up and dragged you all the way here while you were unconscious. If I were in your boots I would be pretty fucki-<em>cough</em> pretty darned angry."</p>
<p>Kano did not respond and remained silent.</p>
<p>"You don't have to forgive me now, or ever for that matter. It was a bit of dick-move on my part, I'll admit."</p>
<p>"I am not angry with you," Kano mumbled. "I just... I just want to go back home."</p>
<p>"Oh..." The dwarf named Kam said and halted in his tracks. "I'm sorry," he said finally with an empathetic frown.</p>
<p>"I can barely imagine what you must be going through. This shouldn't be something a child has to go through. But we cannot succumb to despair at this juncture. What matters is that you're alive. My father always used to say that, 'all problems can be resolved with two things, time and effort'. You are young, and have all the time in the world. AND, as you're alive, you can continue to apply effort. I promise you that you will be back with your original family in no time!" Kam encouraged as his red and bushy whiskers danced with excitement.</p>
<p>Kano could understand the man's intention, he really did, but his sorrow was palpable and overpowering. Though before he could get overwhelmed by that emotion, he was attracted by the massive mural on the wall to his right. The mural extended accross the massive hallway, and it wasn't like any mural he had ever seen in his entire life (which was admittedly short).</p>
<p>The sheer scale of the artwork was breathtaking, extending beyond his line of sight, its detailed segments unfolding like chapters of an epic saga. The uniqueness of the mural struck Kano profoundly; it was a symphony of materials rather than mere strokes of paint or ink. Crafted from an array of lustrous metals, volcanic stone, and pristine white marble, the mural was a testament to both artistic brilliance and the richness of the materials themselves.</p>
<p>The use of metals was particularly ingenious. The litany of colours were achieved through a smattering of what could only be thought of as alloys (the kind he had seen in the jewellery stores in Radiant City). Of the metals in the mural, Kano could only place his finger on the three main ones that offered a reddish-brown, shiny white, and resplendent ochre - copper, silver, and gold respectively. These metals, amongst others that offered otherworldly colours like turquoise, amber, viridian, and much more, were intertwined skillfully, their natural hues lending a vibrant, almost lifelike quality to the scenes. The gold caught the ambient light and seemed to glow with an internal warmth, making certain elements of the mural almost leap from the wall. Silver was used to a more subtle effect, its understated elegance giving life to the quieter moments depicted in the sprawling narrative. Copper, with its earthy tone, grounded the scenes in a sense of realism, despite their fantastical nature.</p>
<p>Equally impressive was the incorporation of volcanic stone. Its dark, rough texture contrasted sharply with the smoothness of the metals and marble, creating a visual and tactile interplay that spoke of the diverse elements of nature. The stone was not merely a backdrop; it was a character in its own right, shaping the mood of each scene with its brooding presence.</p>
<p>The white marble played a crucial role too, providing a canvas of purity and clarity against which the drama of the mural unfolded. Its smooth surface was etched with intricate details, so fine that Kano felt he could spend hours examining just a small section and still discover new nuances. The marble's brightness highlighted the depth and richness of the other materials, creating a harmonious balance.</p>
<p>What truly set the mural apart, however, was the way it told its story. The scenes were divided into segments, reminiscent of a comic book, but with a fluidity that transcended the static nature of printed pages. Dwarven script was etched strategically throughout, offering a type of narrative thread that wove the scenes together. Each segment, while a complete story in itself, connected seamlessly with the next, creating a continuous narrative that was both atomic and sequential.</p>
<p>As Kano's eyes traveled across the mural, he noticed how the scenes depicted both the mundane and the mythical. There were representations of everyday life in a dwarven society, interspersed with grander, more fantastical elements – legendary battles, mythical creatures, and tales of heroism. The contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary was rendered with such skill that it seemed as though the mundane was elevated, and the fantastic was made tangible.</p>
<p>After deliberate inspection, Kano realized that the mural was not just a piece of art; it was a condensation of the civilization, a visual representation of its history, mythology, and values - rules of law that had taken art form. The interplay of the different materials, each with its own distinct character, mirrored the diversity and complexity of the stories being told. The mural was a living entity, its stones and metals holding within them the essence of a culture that was both ancient and enduring.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kam stepped forward and affirmed Kano's conclusion. "This is the Tapestry of Law. Every Dwarven city has one - at least a personal interpretation of it. Though the interpretive aspect only extends to the way in which the stories are expressed. The story itself remains unchanged. It is, after all, necessary to unify the way in which the rules are understood."</p>
<p>"So its like a book of law?" Kano rephrased.</p>
<p>"A book? What's that?" Kam responded in confusion.</p>
<p>Kano looked back with equal confusion. "You know... a book."</p>
<p>"I heard you the first time, kid," Kam said. "I don't know what a book is."</p>
